alt="T" />o my readers: Well, my dears, here is what you have asked for: another
"Oz Book" about Dorothy's strange adventures. Toto is in this story,
because you wanted him to be there, and many other characters which you
will recognize are in the story, too. Indeed, the wishes of my little
correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible, and if the
story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves, you must
remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down,
and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it.</p>

<p>In the preface to "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz" I said I would like to
write some stories that were not "Oz" stories, because I thought I had
written about Oz long enough; but since that volume was published I have
been fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to "write
more about Dorothy," and "more about Oz," and since I write only to
please the children I shall try to respect their wishes.</p>

<p>There are some new characters in this book that ought to win your love.
I'm very fond of the shaggy man myself, and I think you will like him,
too. As for Polychrome&mdash;the Rainbow's Daughter&mdash;and stupid little
Button-Bright, they seem to have brought a new element of fun into these
Oz stories, and I am glad I discovered them. Yet I am anxious to have
you write and tell me how you like them.</p>

<p>Since this book was written I have received some very remarkable news
from The Land of Oz, which has greatly astonished me. I believe it will
astonish you, too, my dears, when you hear it. But it is such a long and
exciting story that it must be saved for another book&mdash;and perhaps that
book will be the last story that will ever be told about the Land of Oz.</p>

<p>"PLEASE, miss," said the shaggy man, "can you tell me the road to
Butterfield?"</p>

<p>Dorothy looked him over. Yes, he was shaggy, all right; but there was a
twinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she replied; "I can tell you. But it isn't this road at all."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"You cross the ten-acre lot, follow the lane to the highway, go north to
the five branches, and take&mdash;let me see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure, miss; see as far as Butterfield, if you like," said the
shaggy man.</p>

<p>"You take the branch next the willow stump, I b'lieve; or else the
branch by the gopher holes; or else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't any of 'em do, miss?"</p>

<p>"'Course not, Shaggy Man. You must take the right road to get to
Butterfield."</p>

<p>"And is that the one by the gopher stump, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Dorothy; "I shall have to show you the way; you're so
stupid. Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet."</p>

<p>The shaggy man waited. He had an oat-straw in his mouth, which he chewed
slowly as if it tasted good; but it didn't. There was an apple-tree
beside the house, and some apples had fallen to the ground. The shaggy
man thought they would taste better than the oat-straw, so he walked
over to get some. A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out
of the farm-house and ran madly toward the shaggy man, who had already
picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of
his shaggy coat. The little dog barked, and made a dive for the shaggy
man's leg; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big
pocket along with the apples. He took more apples, afterward, for many
were on the ground; and each one that he tossed into his pocket hit the
little dog somewhere upon the head or back, and made him growl. The
little dog's name was Toto, and he was sorry he had been put in the
shaggy man's pocket.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i015.png"

<p>Pretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet, and she
called out:</p>

<p>"Come on, Shaggy Man, if you want me to show you the road to
Butterfield." She climbed the fence into the ten-acre lot and he
followed her, walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in
the pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice
them.</p>

<p>"My, but you're clumsy!" said the little girl. "Are your feet tired?"</p>

<p>"No, miss; it's my whiskers; they tire very easily this warm weather,"
said he. "I wish it would snow; don't you?"</p>

<p>"'Course not, Shaggy Man," replied Dorothy, giving him a severe look.
"If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the
wheat; and then Uncle Henry wouldn't have any crops; and that would make
him poor; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the shaggy man. "It won't snow, I guess. Is this the
lane?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dorothy, climbing another fence; "I'll go as far as the
highway with you."</p>

<p>"Thankee, miss; you're very kind for your size, I'm sure," said he
gratefully.</p>

<p>"It isn't everyone who knows the road to Butterfield," Dorothy remarked
as she tripped along the lane; "but I've driven there many a time with
Uncle Henry, and so I b'lieve I could find it blindfolded."</p>

<p>"Don't do that, miss," said the shaggy man, earnestly; "you might make a
mistake."</p>

<p>"I won't," she answered, laughing. "Here's the highway. Now, it's the
second&mdash;no, the third turn to the left&mdash;or else it's the fourth. Let's
see. The first one is by the elm tree; and the second is by the gopher
holes; and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what?" he inquired, putting his hands in his coat pockets. Toto
grabbed a finger and bit it; the shaggy man took his hand out of that
pocket quickly, and said "Oh!"</p>

<p>Dorothy did not notice. She was shading her eyes from the sun with her
arm, looking anxiously down the road.</p>

<p>"Come on," she commanded. "It's only a little way farther, so I may as
well show you."</p>

<p>After a while they came to the place where five roads branched in
different directions; Dorothy pointed to one, and said:</p>

<p>"That's it, Shaggy Man."</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged, miss," he said, and started along another road.</p>

<p>"Not that one!" she cried; "you're going wrong."</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"I thought you said that other was the road to Butterfield," said he,
running his fingers through his shaggy whiskers in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>"So it is."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go to Butterfield, miss."</p>

<p>"You don't?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I wanted you to show me the road, so I shouldn't go
there by mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh! Where <i>do</i> you want to go to, then?"</p>

<p>"I'm not particular, miss."</p>

<p>This answer astonished the little girl; and it made her provoked, too,
to think she had taken all this trouble for nothing.</p>

<p>"There are a good many roads here," observed the shaggy man, turning
slowly around, like a human windmill.</p>

<p>"Seems to me a person could go 'most anywhere, from this place."</p>

<p>Dorothy turned around too, and gazed in surprise. There <i>were</i> a good
many roads; more than she had ever seen before. She tried to count them,
knowing there ought to be five; but when she had counted seventeen she
grew bewildered and stopped, for the roads were as many as the spokes of
a wheel and ran in every direction from the place where they stood; so
if she kept on counting she was likely to count some of the roads twice.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she exclaimed. "There used to be only five roads, highway and
all. And now&mdash;why, where's the highway, Shaggy Man?"</p>

<p>"Can't say, miss," he responded, sitting down upon the ground as if
tired with standing. "Wasn't it here a minute ago?"</p>

<p>"I thought so," she answered, greatly perplexed. "And I saw the gopher
holes, too, and the dead stump; but they're not here now. These roads
are all strange&mdash;and what a lot of them there are! Where do you suppose
they all go to?"</p>

<p>"Roads," observed the shaggy man, "don't go anywhere. They stay in one
place, so folks can walk on them."</p>

<p>He put his hand in his side-pocket and drew out an apple&mdash;quick, before
Toto could bite him again. The little dog got his head out this time
and said "Bow-wow!" so loudly that it made Dorothy jump.</p>

<p>"O Toto!" she cried; "where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"I brought him along," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"What for?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To guard these apples in my pocket, miss, so no one would steal them."</p>

<p>With one hand the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating,
while with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped
him to the ground. Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking
joyfully at his release from the dark pocket. When the child had patted
his head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue hanging out
one side of his mouth, and looked up into her face with his bright brown
eyes, as if asking her what they should do next.</p>

<p>Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar
landmark; but everything was strange. Between the branches of the many
roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't
see anywhere the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything
she had ever seen before&mdash;except the shaggy man and Toto.</p>

<p>Besides this, she had turned around and around so many times, trying to
find out where she was, that now she couldn't even tell which direction
the farm-house ought to be in; and this began to worry her and make her
feel anxious.</p>

<p>"I'm 'fraid, Shaggy Man," she said, with a sigh, "that we're lost!"</p>

<p>"That's nothing to be afraid of," he replied, throwing away the core of
his apple and beginning to eat another one. "Each of these roads must
lead somewhere, or it wouldn't be here. So what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"I want to go home again," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you?" said he.</p>

<p>"I don't know which road to take."</p>

<p>"That is too bad," he said, shaking his shaggy head gravely. "I wish I
could help you; but I can't. I'm a stranger in these parts."</p>

<p>"Seems as if I were, too," she said, sitting down beside him. "It's
funny. A few minutes ago I was home, and I just came to show you the way
to Butterfield&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I shouldn't make a mistake and go there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now I'm lost myself and don't now how to get home!"</p>

<p>"Have an apple," suggested the shaggy man, handing her one with pretty
red cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry," said Dorothy, pushing it away.</p>

<p>"But you may be, to-morrow; then you'll be sorry you didn't eat the
apple," said he.</p>

<p>"If I am, I'll eat the apple then," promised Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there won't be any apple then," he returned, beginning to eat
the red-cheeked one himself. "Dogs sometimes can find their way home
better than people," he went on; "perhaps your dog can lead you back to
the farm."</p>

<p>"Will you, Toto?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>Toto wagged his tail vigorously.</p>

<p>"All right," said the girl; "let's go home."</p>

<p>Toto looked around a minute, and dashed up one of the roads.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Shaggy Man," called Dorothy, and ran after Toto. The little
dog pranced briskly along for some distance; when he turned around and
looked at his mistress questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't 'spect <i>me</i> to tell you anything; I don't know the way," she
said. "You'll have to find it yourself."</p>

<p>But Toto couldn't. He wagged his tail, and sneezed, and shook his ears,
and trotted back where they had left the shaggy man. From here he
started along another road; then came back and tried another; but each
time he found the way strange and decided it would not take them to the
farm house. Finally, when Dorothy had begun to tire with chasing after
him, Toto sat down panting beside the shaggy man and gave up.</p>

<p>Dorothy sat down, too, very thoughtful. The little girl had encountered
some queer adventures since she came to live at the farm; but this was
the queerest of them all. To get lost in fifteen minutes, so near to
her home and in the unromantic State of Kansas, was an experience that
fairly bewildered her.</p>

<p>"Will your folks worry?" asked the shaggy man, his eyes twinkling in a
pleasant way.</p>

<p>"I s'pose so," answered Dorothy, with a sigh. "Uncle Henry says there's
<i>always</i> something happening to me; but I've always come home safe at
the last. So perhaps he'll take comfort and think I'll come home safe
this time."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will," said the shaggy man, smilingly nodding at her.
"Good little girls never come to any harm, you know. For my part, I'm
good, too; so nothing ever hurts me."</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at him curiously. His clothes were shaggy, his boots were
shaggy and full of holes, and his hair and whiskers were shaggy. But his
smile was sweet and his eyes were kind.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you want to go to Butterfield?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because a man lives there who owes me fifteen cents, and if I went to
Butterfield and he saw me he'd want to pay me the money. I don't want
money, my dear."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Money," declared the shaggy man, "makes people proud and haughty; I
don't want to be proud and haughty. All I want is to have people love
me; and as long as I own the Love Magnet everyone I meet is sure to love
me dearly."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i023.png"

/><br />"THIS, MY DEAR, IS THE WONDERFUL LOVE MAGNET."</p>

<p>"The Love Magnet! Why, what's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you, if you won't tell anyone," he answered, in a low,
mysterious voice.</p>

<p>"There isn't any one to tell, 'cept Toto," said the girl.</p>

<p>The shaggy man searched in one pocket, carefully; and in another pocket;
and in a third. At last he drew out a small parcel wrapped in crumpled
paper and tied with a cotton string. He unwound the string, opened the
parcel, and took out a bit of metal shaped like a horseshoe. It was dull
and brown, and not very pretty.</p>

<p>"This, my dear," said he, impressively, "is the wonderful Love Magnet.
It was given me by an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islands&mdash;where there are no
sandwiches at all&mdash;and as long as I carry it every living thing I meet
will love me dearly."</p>

<p>"Why didn't the Eskimo keep it?" she asked, looking at the Magnet with
interest.</p>

<p>"He got tired being loved and longed for some one to hate him. So he
gave me the Magnet and the very next day a grizzly bear ate him."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he sorry then?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"He didn't say," replied the shaggy man, wrapping and tying the Love
Magnet with great care and putting it away in another pocket. "But the
bear didn't seem sorry a bit," he added.</p>

<p>"Did you know the bear?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i025.png"
width="550px"
height="363px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Yes; we used to play ball together in the Caviar Islands. The bear
loved me because I had the Love Magnet. I couldn't blame him for eating
the Eskimo, because it was his nature to do so."</p>

<p>"Once," said Dorothy, "I knew a Hungry Tiger who longed to eat fat
babies, because it was his nature to; but he never ate any because he
had a Conscience."</p>

<p>"This bear," replied the shaggy man, with a sigh, "had no Conscience,
you see."</p>

<p>The shaggy man sat silent for several minutes, apparently considering
the cases of the bear and the tiger, while Toto watched him with an air
of great interest. The little dog was doubtless thinking of his ride in
the shaggy man's pocket and planning to keep out of reach in the future.</p>

<p>At last the shaggy man turned and inquired, "What's your name, little
girl?"</p>

<p>"My name's Dorothy," said she, jumping up again, "but what are we going
to do? We can't stay here forever, you know."</p>

<p>"Let's take the seventh road," he suggested. "Seven is a lucky number
for little girls named Dorothy."</p>

<p>"The seventh from where?"</p>

<p>"From where you begin to count."</p>

<p>So she counted seven roads, and the seventh looked just like all the
others; but the shaggy man got up from the ground where he had been
sitting and started down this road as if sure it was the best way to go;
and Dorothy and Toto followed him.</p>


<p><a name="CHAP_2" id="CHAP_2"></a></p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i027.png"
width="550px"
alt="Dorothy Meets Button-bright" /></p>


<p>THE seventh road was a good road, and curved this way and that&mdash;winding
through green meadows and fields covered with daisies and buttercups and
past groups of shady trees. There were no houses of any sort to be seen,
and for some distance they met with no living creature at all.</p>

<p>Dorothy began to fear they were getting a good way from the
<i>farm-house</i>, since here everything was strange to her; but it would do
no good at all to go back where the other roads all met, because the
next one they chose might lead her just as far from home.</p>

<p>She kept on beside the shaggy man, who whistled cheerful tunes to
beguile the journey, until by-and-by they followed a turn in the road
and saw before them a big chestnut tree making a shady spot over the
highway. In the shade sat a little boy dressed in sailor clothes, who
was digging a hole in the earth with a bit of wood. He must have been
digging some time, because the hole was already big enough to drop a
foot-ball into.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Toto and the shaggy man came to a halt before the little
boy, who kept on digging in a sober and persistent fashion.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>He looked up at her calmly. His face was round and chubby and his eyes
were big, blue, and earnest.</p>

<p>"I'm Button-Bright," said he.</p>

<p>"But what's you real name?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Button-Bright."</p>

<p>"That isn't a really-truly name!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" he asked, still digging.</p>

<p>"'Course not. It's just a&mdash;a thing to call you by. You must have a
name."</p>

<p>"Must I?"</p>

<p>"To be sure. What does your mamma call you?"</p>

<p>He paused in his digging and tried to think.</p>

<p>"Papa always said I was bright as a button; so mamma always called me
Button-Bright," he said.</p>

<p>"What is your papa's name?"</p>

<p>"Just Papa."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the shaggy man, smiling. "We'll call the boy
Button-Bright, as his mamma does. That name is as good as any, and
better than some."</p>

<p>Dorothy watched the boy dig.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How did you come here?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," he said again.</p>

<p>"Don't you know where you came from?"</p>

<p>"No," said he.</p>

<p>"Why, he must be lost," she said to the shaggy man. She turned to the
boy once more.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Dig," said he.</p>

<p>"But you can't dig forever; and what are you going to do then?" she
persisted.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said the boy.</p>

<p>"But you <i>must</i> know <i>something</i>," declared Dorothy, getting provoked.</p>

<p>"Must I?" he asked, looking up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course you must."</p>

<p>"What must I know?"</p>

<p>"What's going to become of you, for one thing," she answered.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> know what's going to become of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not 'zactly," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Do you know what's going to become of <i>you</i>?" he continued, earnestly.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i030.png"
width="550px"
height="363px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"I can't say I do," replied Dorothy, remembering her present
difficulties.</p>

<p>The shaggy man laughed.</p>

<p>"No one knows everything, Dorothy," he said.</p>

<p>"But Button-Bright doesn't seem to know <i>anything</i>," she declared. "Do
you, Button-Bright?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, which had pretty curls all over it, and replied with
perfect calmness:</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>Never before had Dorothy met with any one who could give her so little
information. The boy was evidently lost, and his people would be sure to
worry about him. He seemed two or three years younger than Dorothy, and
was prettily dressed, as if some one loved him dearly and took much
pains to make him look well. How, then, did he come to be in this lonely
road? she wondered.</p>

<p>Near Button-Bright, on the ground, lay a sailor hat with a gilt anchor
on the band. His sailor trousers were long and wide at the bottom, and
the broad collar of his blouse had gold anchors sewed on its corners.
The boy was still digging at his hole.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to sea?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"To see what?" answered Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I mean have you ever been where there's water?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Button-Bright; "there's a well in our back yard."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," cried Dorothy. "I mean, have you ever been on a
big ship floating on a big ocean?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said he.</p>

<p>"Then why do you wear sailor clothes?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," he answered, again.</p>

<p>Dorothy was in despair.</p>

<p>"You're just <i>awful</i> stupid, Button-Bright," she said.</p>

<p>"Am I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are."</p>

<p>"Why?" looking up at her with big eyes.</p>

<p>She was going to say: "Don't know," but stopped herself in time.</p>

<p>"That's for you to answer," she replied.</p>

<p>"It's no use asking Button-Bright questions," said the shaggy man, who
had been eating another apple; "but some one ought to take care of the
poor little chap, don't you think? So he'd better come along with us."</p>

<p>Toto had been looking with great curiosity into the hole which the boy
was digging, and growing more and more excited every minute, perhaps
thinking that Button-Bright was after some wild animal. The little dog
began barking loudly and jumped into the hole himself, where he began to
dig with his tiny paws, making the earth fly in all directions. It
spattered over the boy. Dorothy seized him and raised him to his feet,
brushing his clothes with her hand.</p>

<p>"Stop that, Toto!" she called. "There aren't any mice or woodchucks in
that hole, so don't be foolish."</p>

<p>Toto stopped, sniffed at the hole suspiciously, and jumped out of it,
wagging his tail as if he had done something important.</p>

<p>"Well," said the shaggy man, "let's start on, or we won't get anywhere
before night comes."</p>

<p>"Where do you expect to get to?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I'm like Button-Bright; I don't know," answered the shaggy man, with a
laugh. "But I've learned from long experience that every road leads
somewhere, or there wouldn't be any road; so it's likely that if we
travel long enough, my dear, we will come to some place or another in
the end. What place it will be we can't even guess at this moment, but
we're sure to find out when we get there."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Dorothy; "that seems reas'n'ble, Shaggy Man."</p>

<p>BUTTON-BRIGHT took the shaggy man's hand willingly; for the shaggy man
had the Love Magnet, you know, which was the reason Button-Bright had
loved him at once. They started on, with Dorothy on one side, and Toto
on the other, the little party trudging along more cheerfully than you
might have supposed. The girl was getting used to queer adventures,
which interested her very much. Wherever Dorothy went Toto was sure to
go, like Mary's little lamb. Button-Bright didn't seem a bit afraid or
worried because he was lost, and the shaggy man had no home, perhaps,
and was as happy in one place as in another.</p>

<p>Before long they saw ahead of them a fine big arch spanning the road,
and when they came nearer they found that the arch was beautifully
carved and decorated with rich colors. A row of peacocks with spread
tails ran along the top of it, and all the feathers were gorgeously
painted. In the center was a large fox's head, and the fox wore a shrewd
and knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes and a
small golden crown with shiny points on top of its head.</p>

<p>While the travellers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch
there suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiers&mdash;only the
soldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms. They wore green jackets and
yellow pantaloons, and their little round caps and their high boots were
a bright red color. Also there was a big red bow tied about the middle
of each long, bushy tail. Each soldier was armed with a wooden sword
having an edge of sharp teeth set in a row, and the sight of these teeth
at first caused Dorothy to shudder.</p>

<p>A captain marched in front of the company of fox-soldiers, his uniform
embroidered with gold braid to make it handsomer than the others.</p>

<p>Almost before our friends realized it the soldiers had surrounded them
on all sides, and the captain was calling out in a harsh voice:</p>

<p>"Surrender! You are our prisoners."</p>

<p>"What's a pris'ner?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"A prisoner is a captive," replied the fox-captain, strutting up and
down with much dignity.</p>

<p>"What's a captive?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"You're one," said the captain.</p>

<p>That made the shaggy man laugh.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, captain," he said, bowing politely to all the foxes and
very low to their commander. "I trust you are in good health, and that
your families are all well?"</p>

<p>The fox-captain looked at the shaggy man, and his sharp features grew
pleasant and smiling.</p>

<p>"We're pretty well, thank you, Shaggy Man," said he; and Dorothy knew
that the Love Magnet was working and that all the foxes now loved the
shaggy man because of it. But Toto didn't know this, for he began
barking angrily and tried to bite the captain's hairy leg where it
showed between his red boots and his yellow pantaloons.</p>

<p>"Stop, Toto!" cried the little girl, seizing the dog in her arms. "These
are our friends."</p>

<p>"Why, so we are!" remarked the captain in tones of astonishment. "I
thought at first we were enemies, but it seems you are friends, instead.
You must come with me to see King Dox."</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked Button-Bright, with earnest eyes.</p>

<p>"King Dox of Foxville; the great and wise sovereign who rules over our
community."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i037.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?" inquired Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Don't ask so many questions, little boy."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Ah, why, indeed?" exclaimed the captain, looking at Button-Bright
admiringly. "If you don't ask questions you will learn nothing. True
enough. I was wrong. You're a very clever little boy, come to think of
it&mdash;very clever indeed. But now, friends, please come with me, for it is
my duty to escort you at once to the royal palace."</p>

<p>The soldiers marched back through the arch again, and with them marched
the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright. Once through the
opening they found a fine, big city spread out before them, all the
houses of carved marble in beautiful colors. The decorations were mostly
birds and other fowl, such as peacocks, pheasants, turkeys,
prairie-chickens, ducks, and geese. Over each doorway was carved a head
representing the fox who lived in that house, this effect being quite
pretty and unusual.</p>

<p>As our friends marched along, some of the foxes came out on the porches
and balconies to get a view of the strangers. These foxes were all
handsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of
feathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which
Dorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive.</p>

<p>Button-Bright stared until his eyes were big and round, and he would
have stumbled and fallen more than once had not the shaggy man grasped
his hand tightly. They were all interested, and Toto was so excited he
wanted to bark every minute and to chase and fight every fox he caught
sight of; but Dorothy held his little wiggling body fast in her arms and
commanded him to be good and behave himself. So he finally quieted down,
like a wise doggy, deciding there were too many foxes in Foxville to
fight at one time.</p>

<p>By-and-bye they came to a big square, and in the center of the square
stood the royal palace. Dorothy knew it at once because it had over its
great door the carved head of a fox just like the one she had seen on
the arch, and this fox was the only one who wore a golden crown.</p>

<p>There were many fox-soldiers guarding the door, but they bowed to the
captain and admitted him without question. The captain led them through
many rooms, where richly dressed foxes were sitting on beautiful chairs
or sipping tea, which was being passed around by fox-servants in white
aprons. They came to a big doorway covered with heavy curtains of cloth
of gold.</p>

<p>Beside this doorway stood a huge drum. The fox-captain went to this drum
and knocked his knees against it&mdash;first one knee and then the other&mdash;so
that the drum said; "Boom-boom."</p>

<p>"You must all do exactly what I do," ordered the captain; so the shaggy
man pounded the drum with his knees, and so did Dorothy and so did
Button-Bright. The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little fat
knees, because he liked the sound of it; but the captain stopped him.
Toto couldn't pound the drum with his knees and he didn't know enough to
wag his tail against it, so Dorothy pounded the drum for him and that
made him bark, and when the little dog barked the fox-captain scowled.</p>

<p>The golden curtains drew back far enough to make an opening, through
which marched the captain with the others.</p>

<p>The broad, long room they entered was decorated in gold with
stained-glass windows of splendid colors. In the center of the room,
upon a richly carved golden throne, sat the fox-king, surrounded by a
group of other foxes, all of whom wore great spectacles over their eyes,
making them look solemn and important.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i040.png"
width="550px"
height="359px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Dorothy knew the King at once, because she had seen his head carved on
the arch and over the doorway of the palace. Having met with several
other kings in her travels she knew what to do, and at once made a low
bow before the throne. The shaggy man bowed, too, and Button-Bright
bobbed his head and said "Hello."</p>

<p>"Most wise and noble Potentate of Foxville," said the captain,
addressing the King in a pompous voice, "I humbly beg to report that I
found these strangers on the road leading to your Foxy Majesty's
dominions, and have therefore brought them before you, as is my duty."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so," said the King, looking at them keenly. "What brought you here,
strangers?"</p>

<p>"Our legs, may it please your Royal Hairiness," replied the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"What is your business here?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"To get away as soon as possible," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>The King didn't know about the Magnet, of course; but it made him love
the shaggy man at once.</p>

<p>"Do just as you please about going away," he said; "but I'd like to
<i>show you</i> the sights of my city and to entertain your party while you
are here. We feel highly honored to have little Dorothy with us, I
assure you, and we appreciate her kindness in making us a visit. For
whatever country Dorothy visits is sure to become famous."</p>

<p>This speech greatly surprised the little girl, who asked:</p>

<p>"How did your Majesty know my name?"</p>

<p>"Why, everybody knows you, my dear," said the Fox-King. "Don't you
realize that? You are quite an important personage since Princess Ozma
of Oz made you her friend."</p>

<p>"Do you know Ozma?" she asked, wondering.</p>

<p>"I regret to say that I do not," he answered, sadly; "but I hope to
meet her soon. You know the Princess Ozma is to celebrate her birthday
on the twenty-first of this month."</p>

<p>"Is she?" said Dorothy. "I didn't know that."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is to be the most brilliant royal ceremony ever held in any
city in Fairyland, and I hope you will try to get me an invitation."</p>

<p>Dorothy thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Ozma would invite you if I asked her," she said; "but how
could you get to the Land of Oz and the Emerald City? It's a good way
from Kansas."</p>

<p>"Kansas!" he exclaimed, surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; we are in Kansas now, aren't we?" she returned.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i042.png"
width="550px"
height="366px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"What a queer notion!" cried the Fox-King, beginning to laugh. "Whatever
made you think this is Kansas?"</p>

<p>"I left Uncle Henry's farm only about two hours ago; that's the reason,"
she said, rather perplexed.</p>

<p>"But, tell me, my dear, did you ever see so wonderful a city as Foxville
in Kansas?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"No, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"And haven't you traveled from Oz to Kansas in less than half a jiffy,
by means of the Silver Shoes and the Magic Belt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Majesty," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Then why do you wonder that an hour or two could bring you to Foxville,
which is nearer to Oz than it is to Kansas?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Dorothy; "is this another fairy adventure?"</p>

<p>"It seems to be," said the Fox-King, smiling.</p>

<p>Dorothy turned to the shaggy man, and her face was grave and
reproachful.</p>

<p>"Are you a magician? or a fairy in disguise?" she asked. "Did you
enchant me when you asked the way to Butterfield?"</p>

<p>The shaggy man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Who ever heard of a shaggy fairy?" he replied. "No, Dorothy, my dear;
I'm not to blame for this journey in any way, I assure you. There's
been something strange about me ever since I owned the Love Magnet; but
I don't know what it is any more than you do. I didn't try to get you
away from home, at all. If you want to find your way back to the farm
I'll go with you willingly, and do my best to help you."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the little girl, thoughtfully. "There isn't so much
to see in Kansas as there is here, and I guess Aunt Em won't be <i>very</i>
much worried; that is, if I don't stay away too long."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i044.png"
width="550px"
height="347px"
alt="HIS ROYAL FOXINESS" /></p>

<p>"That's right," declared the Fox-King, nodding approval. "Be contented
with your lot, whatever it happens to be, if you are wise. Which reminds
me that you have a new companion on this adventure&mdash;he looks very
clever and bright."</p>

<p>"He is," said Dorothy; and the shaggy man added:</p>

<p>"That's his name, your Royal Foxiness&mdash;Button Bright."</p>

<p><a name="CHAP_4" id="CHAP_4"></a></p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i046.png"

alt="King Dox" /></p>


<p>IT was amusing to note the expression on the face of King Dox as he
looked the boy over, from his sailor hat to his stubby shoes; and it was
equally diverting to watch Button-Bright stare at the King in return. No
fox ever beheld a fresher, fairer child's face, and no child had ever
before heard a fox talk, or met with one who dressed so handsomely and
ruled so big a city. I am sorry to say that no one had ever told the
little boy much about fairies of any kind; this being the case, it is
easy to understand how much this strange experience startled and
astonished him.</p>

<p>"How do you like us?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't. It's too short an acquaintance," returned his
Majesty. "What do you suppose my name is?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"How should you? Well, I'll tell you. My private name is Dox, but a King
can't be called by his private name; he has to take one that is
official. Therefore my official name is King Renard the Fourth. Ren-ard
with the accent on the 'Ren'."</p>

<p>"What's 'ren'?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"How clever!" exclaimed the King, turning a pleased face toward his
counselors. "This boy is indeed remarkably bright. 'What's 'ren''? he
asks; and of course 'ren' is nothing at all, all by itself. Yes; he's
very bright indeed."</p>

<p>"That question is what your Majesty might call foxy," said one of the
counselors, an old grey fox.</p>

<p>"So it is," declared the King. Turning again to Button-Bright, he asked:</p>

<p>"Having told you my name, what would you call me?"</p>

<p>"King Dox," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause 'ren''s nothing at all," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Good! Very good indeed! You certainly have a brilliant mind. Do you
know why two and two make four?"</p>

<p>"No," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Clever! clever indeed. Of course you don't know. Nobody knows why; we
only know it's so, and can't tell why it's so. Button-Bright, those
curls and blue eyes do not go well with so much wisdom. They make you
look too youthful, and hide your real cleverness. Therefore, I will do
you a great favor. I will confer upon you the head of a fox, so that you
may hereafter look as bright as you really are."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i048.png"

<p>As he spoke the King waved his paw toward the boy, and at once the
pretty curls and fresh round face and big blue eyes were gone, while in
their place a fox's head appeared upon Button-Bright's shoulders&mdash;a
hairy head with a sharp nose, pointed ears, and keen little eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that!" cried Dorothy, shrinking back from her transformed
companion with a shocked and dismayed face.</p>

<p>"Too late, my dear; it's done. But you also shall have a fox's head if
you can prove you're as clever as Button-Bright."</p>

<p>"I don't want it; it's dreadful!" she exclaimed; and, hearing this
verdict, Button-Bright began to boo-hoo just as if he were still a
little boy.</p>

<p>"How can you call that lovely head dreadful?" asked the King. "It's a
much prettier face than he had before, to my notion, and my wife says
I'm a good judge of beauty. Don't cry, little fox-boy. Laugh and be
proud, because you are so highly favored. How do you like the new head,
Button-Bright?"</p>

<p>"D-d-don't n-n-n-know!" sobbed the child.</p>

<p>"Please, <i>please</i> change him back again, your Majesty!" begged Dorothy.</p>

<p>King Renard IV shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't do that," he said; "I haven't the power, even if I wanted to.
No, Button-Bright must wear his fox head, and he'll be sure to love it
dearly as soon as he gets used to it."</p>

<p>Both the shaggy man and Dorothy looked grave and anxious, for they were
sorrowful that such a misfortune had overtaken their little companion.
Toto barked at the fox-boy once or twice, not realizing it was his
former friend who now wore the animal head; but Dorothy cuffed the dog
and made him stop. As for the foxes, they all seemed to think
Button-Bright's new head very becoming and that their King had conferred
a great honor on this little stranger.</p>

<p>It was funny to see the boy reach up to feel of his sharp nose and wide
mouth, and wail afresh with grief. He wagged his ears in a comical
manner and tears were in his little black eyes. But Dorothy couldn't
laugh at her friend just yet, because she felt so sorry.</p>

<p>Just then three little fox-princesses, daughters of the King, entered
the room, and when they saw Button-Bright one exclaimed: "How lovely he
is!" and the next one cried in delight: "How sweet he is!" and the third
princess clapped her hands with pleasure and said, "How beautiful he
is!"</p>

<p>Button-Bright stopped crying and asked timidly:</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"In all the world there is not another face so pretty," declared the
biggest fox-princess.</p>

<p>"You must live with us always, and be our brother," said the next.</p>

<p>"We shall all love you dearly," the third said.</p>

<p>This praise did much to comfort the boy, and he looked around and tried
to smile. It was a pitiful attempt, because the fox face was new and
stiff, and Dorothy thought his expression more stupid than before the
transformation.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to be going now," said the shaggy man, uneasily, for
he didn't know what the King might take into his head to do next.</p>

<p>"Don't leave us yet, I beg of you," pleaded King Renard. "I intend to
have several days of feasting and merrymaking, in honor of your visit."</p>

<p>"Have it after we're gone, for we can't wait," said Dorothy, decidedly.
But seeing this displeased the King, she added: "If I'm going to get
Ozma to invite you to her party I'll have to find her as soon as
poss'ble, you know."</p>

<p>In spite of all the beauty of Foxville and the gorgeous dresses of its
inhabitants, both the girl and the shaggy man felt they were not quite
safe there, and would be glad to see the last of it.</p>

<p>"But it is now evening," the King reminded them, "and you must stay with
us until morning, anyhow. Therefore I invite you to be my guests at
dinner, and to attend the theater afterward and sit in the royal box.
To-morrow morning, if you really insist upon it, you may resume your
journey."</p>

<p>They consented to this, and some of the fox-servants led them to a suite
of lovely rooms in the big palace.</p>

<p>Button-Bright was afraid to be left alone, so Dorothy took him into her
own room. While a maid-fox dressed the little girl's hair&mdash;which was a
bit tangled&mdash;and put some bright, fresh ribbons in it, another maid-fox
combed the hair on poor Button-Bright's face and head and brushed it
carefully, tying a pink bow to each of his pointed ears. The maids
wanted to dress the children in fine costumes of woven feathers, such as
all the foxes wore; but neither of them consented to that.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i052.png"
width="550px"
height="363px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"A sailor suit and a fox head do not go well together," said one of the
maids; "for no fox was ever a sailor that I can remember."</p>

<p>"I'm not a fox!" cried Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Alas, no," agreed the maid. "But you've got a lovely fox head on your
skinny shoulders, and that's <i>almost</i> as good as being a fox."</p>

<p>The boy, reminded of his misfortune, began to cry again. Dorothy petted
and comforted him and promised to find some way to restore him his own
head.</p>

<p>"If we can manage to get to Ozma," she said, "the Princess will change
you back to yourself in half a second; so you just wear that fox head as
comf't'bly as you can, dear, and don't worry about it at all. It isn't
nearly as pretty as your own head, no matter what the foxes say; but you
can get along with it for a little while longer, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright, doubtfully; but he didn't cry any more
after that.</p>

<p>Dorothy let the maids pin ribbons to her shoulders, after which they
were ready for the King's dinner. When they met the shaggy man in the
splendid drawing-room of the palace they found him just the same as
before. He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones,
because if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man, he said,
and he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again.</p>

<p>He told Dorothy he had brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers; but she
thought he must have brushed them the wrong way, for they were quite as
shaggy as before.</p>

<p>As for the company of foxes assembled to dine with the strangers, they
were most beautifully costumed, and their rich dresses made Dorothy's
simple gown and Button-Bright's sailor suit and the shaggy man's shaggy
clothes look commonplace. But they treated their guests with great
respect and the King's dinner was a very good dinner indeed.</p>

<p>Foxes, as you know, are fond of chicken and other fowl; so they served
chicken soup and roasted turkey and stewed duck and fried grouse and
broiled quail and goose pie, and as the cooking was excellent the King's
guests enjoyed the meal and ate heartily of the various dishes.</p>

<p>The party went to the theater, where they saw a play acted by foxes
dressed in costumes of brilliantly colored feathers. The play was about
a fox-girl who was stolen by some wicked wolves and carried to their
cave; and just as they were about to kill her and eat her a company of
fox-soldiers marched up, saved the girl, and put all the wicked wolves
to death.</p>

<p>"How do you like it?" the King asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," she answered. "It reminds me of one of Mr. Aesop's
fables."</p>

<p>"Don't mention Aesop to me, I beg of you!" exclaimed King Dox. "I hate
that man's name. He wrote a good deal about foxes, but always made them
out cruel and wicked, whereas we are gentle and kind, as you may see."</p>

<p>"But his fables showed you to be wise and clever, and more shrewd than
other animals," said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i055.png"
width="550px"
height="332px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"So we are. There is no question about our knowing more than men do,"
replied the King, proudly. "But we employ our wisdom to do good, instead
of harm; so that horrid Aesop did not know what he was talking about."</p>

<p>They did not like to contradict him, because they felt he ought to know
the nature of foxes better than men did; so they sat still and watched
the play, and Button-Bright became so interested that for the time he
forgot he wore a fox head.</p>

<p>Afterward they went back to the palace and slept in soft beds stuffed
with feathers; for the foxes raised many fowl for food, and used their
feathers for clothing and to sleep upon.</p>

<p>Dorothy wondered why the animals living in Foxville did not wear just
their own hairy skins, as wild foxes do; when she mentioned it to King
Dox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized.</p>

<p>"But you were born without clothes," she observed, "and you don't seem
to me to need them."</p>

<p>"So were human beings born without clothes," he replied; "and until they
became civilized they wore only their natural skins. But to become
civilized means to dress as elaborately and prettily as possible, and to
make a show of your clothes so your neighbors will envy you, and for
that reason both civilized foxes and civilized humans spend most of
their time dressing themselves."</p>

<p>"I don't," declared the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"That is true," said the King, looking at him carefully: "but perhaps
you are not civilized."</p>

<p>After a sound sleep and a good night's rest they had their breakfast
with the King and then bade his Majesty good-bye.</p>

<p>"You've been kind to us&mdash;'cept poor Button-Bright," said Dorothy, "and
we've had a nice time in Foxville."</p>

<p>"Then," said King Dox, "perhaps you'll be good enough to get me an
invitation to Princess Ozma's birthday celebration."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she promised; "if I see her in time."</p>

<p>"It's on the twenty-first, remember," he continued; "and if you'll just
see that I'm invited I'll find a way to cross the Dreadful Desert into
the marvelous Land of Oz. I've always wanted to visit the Emerald City,
so I'm sure it was fortunate you arrived here just when you did, you
being Princess Ozma's friend and able to assist me in getting the
invitation."</p>

<p>"If I see Ozma I'll ask her to invite you," she replied.</p>

<p>The Fox-King had a delightful luncheon put up for them, which the shaggy
man shoved in his pocket, and the fox-captain escorted them to an arch
at the side of the village opposite the one by which they had entered.
Here they found more soldiers guarding the road.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of enemies?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No; because we are watchful and able to protect ourselves," answered
the captain. "But this road leads to another village peopled by big,
stupid beasts who might cause us trouble if they thought we were afraid
of them."</p>

<p>"What beasts are they?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>The captain hesitated to answer. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city. But do not
be afraid of them. Button-Bright is so wonderfully clever and has now
such an intelligent face that I'm sure he will manage to find a way to
protect you."</p>

<p>This made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy, for they had not so
much confidence in the fox-boy's wisdom as the captain seemed to have.
But as their escort would say no more about the beasts, they bade him
good-bye and proceeded on their journey.</p>

<p>TOTO, now allowed to run about as he pleased, was glad to be free again
and able to bark at the birds and chase the butterflies. The country
around them was charming, yet in the pretty fields of wild-flowers and
groves of leafy trees were no houses whatever, or sign of any
inhabitants. Birds flew through the air and cunning white rabbits darted
amongst the tall grasses and green bushes; Dorothy noticed even the ants
toiling busily along the roadway, bearing gigantic loads of clover seed;
but of people there were none at all.</p>

<p>They walked briskly on for an hour or two, for even little Button-Bright
was a good walker and did not tire easily. At length as they turned a
curve in the road they beheld just before them a curious sight.</p>

<p>A little girl, radiant and beautiful, shapely as a fairy and exquisitely
dressed, was dancing gracefully in the middle of the lonely road,
whirling slowly this way and that, her dainty feet twinkling in
sprightly fashion. She was clad in flowing, fluffy robes of soft
material that reminded Dorothy of woven cobwebs, only it was colored in
soft tintings of violet, rose, topaz, olive, azure, and white, mingled
together most harmoniously in stripes which melted one into the other
with soft blendings. Her hair was like spun gold and floated around her
in a cloud, no strand being fastened or confined by either pin or
ornament or ribbon.</p>

<p>Filled with wonder and admiration our friends approached and stood
watching this fascinating dance. The girl was no taller than Dorothy,
although more slender; nor did she seem any older than our little
heroine.</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused and abandoned the dance, as if for the first time
observing the presence of strangers. As she faced them, shy as a
frightened fawn, poised upon one foot as if to fly the next instant,
Dorothy was astonished to see tears flowing from her violet eyes and
trickling down her lovely rose-hued cheeks. That the dainty maiden
should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising; so Dorothy
asked in a soft, sympathetic voice:</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i061.png"
width="563px"
height="802px"
alt="POLYCHROME&mdash;THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER" /><br />POLYCHROME&mdash;THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER</p>

<p>"Are you unhappy, little girl?"</p>

<p>"Very!" was the reply; "I am lost."</p>

<p>"Why, so are we," said Dorothy, smiling; "but we don't cry about it."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Why not?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I've been lost before, and always got found again," answered
Dorothy, simply.</p>

<p>"But I've never been lost before," murmured the dainty maiden, "and I'm
worried and afraid."</p>

<p>"You were dancing," remarked Dorothy, in a puzzled tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was just to keep warm," explained the maiden, quickly. "It was
not because I felt happy or gay, I assure you."</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at her closely. Her gauzy flowing robes might not be very
warm, yet the weather wasn't at all chilly, but rather mild and balmy,
like a spring day.</p>

<p>"Who are you, dear?" she asked, gently.</p>

<p>"I'm Polychrome," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Polly whom?"</p>

<p>"Polychrome. I'm the Daughter of the Rainbow."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Dorothy, with a gasp; "I didn't know the Rainbow had
children. But I <i>might</i> have known it, before you spoke. You couldn't
really be anything else."</p>

<p>"Why not?" inquired Polychrome, as if surprised.</p>

<p>"Because you're so lovely and sweet."</p>

<p>The little maiden smiled through her tears, came up to Dorothy, and
placed her slender fingers in the Kansas girl's chubby hand.</p>

<p>"You'll be my friend&mdash;won't you?" she said, pleadingly.</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i063.png"
width="550px"
height="344px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Dorothy; and this is my friend Shaggy Man, who owns the Love
Magnet; and this is Button-Bright&mdash;only you don't see him as he really
is because the Fox-King carelessly changed his head into a fox head. But
the real Button-Bright is good to look at, and I hope to get him changed
back to himself, some time."</p>

<p>The Rainbow's Daughter nodded cheerfully, no longer afraid of her new
companions.</p>

<p>"But who is this?" she asked, pointing to Toto, who was sitting before
her wagging his tail in the most friendly manner and admiring the pretty
maid with his bright eyes. "Is this, also, some enchanted person?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Polly&mdash;I may call you Polly, mayn't I? Your whole name's awful
hard to say."</p>

<p>"Call me Polly if you wish, Dorothy."</p>

<p>"Well, Polly, Toto's just a dog; but he has more sense than
Button-Bright, to tell the truth; and I'm very fond of him."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Polychrome, bending gracefully to pat Toto's head.</p>

<p>"But how did the Rainbow's Daughter ever get on this lonely road, and
become lost?" asked the shaggy man, who had listened wonderingly to all
this.</p>

<p>"Why, my father stretched his rainbow over here this morning, so that
one end of it touched this road," was the reply; "and I was dancing upon
the pretty rays, as I love to do, and never noticed I was getting too
far over the bend in the circle. Suddenly I began to slide, and I went
faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground, at the very end.
Just then father lifted the rainbow again, without noticing me at all,
and though I tried to seize the end of it and hold fast, it melted away
entirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold, hard earth!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem cold to me, Polly," said Dorothy; "but perhaps you're
not warmly dressed."</p>

<p>"I'm so used to living nearer the sun," replied the Rainbow's Daughter,
"that at first I feared I would freeze down here. But my dance has
warmed me some, and now I wonder how I am ever to get home again."</p>

<p>"Won't your father miss you, and look for you, and let down another
rainbow for you?"</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i065.png"
width="550px"
height="349px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but he's busy just now because it rains in so many parts of
the world at this season, and he has to set his rainbow in a lot of
different places. What would you advise me to do, Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"Come with us," was the answer. "I'm going to try to find my way to the
Emerald City, which is in the fairy Land of Oz. The Emerald City is
ruled by a friend of mine, the Princess Ozma, and if we can manage to
get there I'm sure she will know a way to send you home to your father
again."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" asked Polychrome, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go with you," said the little maid; "for travel will help
keep me warm, and father can find me in one part of the world as well as
another&mdash;if he gets time to look for me."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said the shaggy man, cheerfully; and they started on
once more. Polly walked beside Dorothy a while, holding her new friend's
hand as if she feared to let it go; but her nature seemed as light and
buoyant as her fleecy robes, for suddenly she darted ahead and whirled
round in a giddy dance. Then she tripped back to them with sparkling
eyes and smiling cheeks, having regained her usual happy mood and
forgotten all her worry about being lost.</p>

<p>They found her a charming companion, and her dancing and laughter&mdash;for
she laughed at times like the tinkling of a silver bell&mdash;did much to
enliven their journey and keep them contented.</p>

<p>WHEN noon came they opened the Fox-King's basket of luncheon, and found
a nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and
butter. As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up
the turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.</p>

<p>"Haven't you any dewdrops, or mist-cakes, or cloud-buns?" asked
Polychrome, longingly.</p>

<p>"'Course not," replied Dorothy. "We eat solid things, down here on the
earth. But there's a bottle of cold tea. Try some, won't you?"</p>

<p>The Rainbow's Daughter watched Button-Bright devour one leg of the
turkey.</p>

<p>"Is it good?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could eat it?"</p>

<p>"Not this," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"But I mean another piece?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to try, for I'm very hungry," she decided, and took a
thin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for
her, as well as a bit of bread and butter. When she tasted it Polychrome
thought the turkey was good&mdash;better even than mist-cakes; but a little
satisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of cold tea.</p>

<p>"That's about as much as a fly would eat," said Dorothy, who was making
a good meal herself. "But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at
all."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" inquired the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"One is a scarecrow who's stuffed with straw, and the other a woodman
made out of tin. They haven't any appetites inside of 'em, you see; so
they never eat anything at all."</p>

<p>"Are they alive?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Dorothy; "and they're very clever and very nice, too.
If we get to Oz I'll introduce them to you."</p>

<p>"Do you really expect to get to Oz?" inquired the shaggy man, taking a
drink of cold tea.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i069.png"

height="868px"
alt="POLLY SIPPED A LITTLE COLD TEA" /><br/>POLLY SIPPED A LITTLE COLD TEA</p>

<p>"I don't know just what to 'spect," answered the child, seriously;
"but I've noticed if I happen to get lost I'm almost sure to come to the
Land of Oz in the end, somehow 'r other; so I may get there this time.
But I can't promise, you know; all I can do is wait and see."</p>

<p>"Will the Scarecrow scare me?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"No; 'cause you're not a crow," she returned. "He has the loveliest
smile you ever saw&mdash;only it's painted on and he can't help it."</p>

<p>Luncheon being over they started again upon their journey, the shaggy
man, Dorothy and Button-Bright walking soberly along, side by side, and
the Rainbow's Daughter dancing merrily before them.</p>

<p>Sometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out
of sight, then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery
laughter. But once she came back more sedately, to say:</p>

<p>"There's a city a little way off."</p>

<p>"I 'spected that," returned Dorothy; "for the fox-people warned us there
was one on this road. It's filled with stupid beasts of some sort, but
we mustn't be afraid of 'em 'cause they won't hurt us."</p>

<p>"All right," said Button-Bright; but Polychrome didn't know whether it
was all right or not.</p>

<p>"It's a big city," she said, "and the road runs straight through it."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the shaggy man; "as long as I carry the Love Magnet
every living thing will love me, and you may be sure I shan't allow any
of my friends to be harmed in any way."</p>

<p>This comforted them somewhat, and they moved on again. Pretty soon they
came to a sign-post that read:</p>

<p class="c">"HAF A MYLE TO DUNKITON."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the shaggy man, "if they're donkeys we've nothing to fear at
all."</p>

<p>"They may kick," said Dorothy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Then we will cut some switches, and make them behave," he replied. At
the first tree he cut himself a long, slender switch from one of the
branches, and shorter switches for the others.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid to order the beasts around," he said; "they're used to
it."</p>

<p>Before long the road brought them to the gates of the city. There was a
high wall all around, which had been whitewashed, and the gate just
before our travelers was a mere opening in the wall, with no bars across
it. No towers or steeples or domes showed above the enclosure, nor was
any living thing to be seen as our friends drew near.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they were about to boldly enter through the opening, there
arose a harsh clamor of sound that swelled and echoed on every side,
until they were nearly deafened by the racket and had to put their
fingers to their ears to keep the noise out.</p>

<p>It was like the firing of many cannon, only there were no cannon-balls
or other missiles to be seen; it was like the rolling of mighty thunder,
only not a cloud was in the sky; it was like the roar of countless
breakers on a rugged seashore, only there was no sea or other water
anywhere about.</p>

<p>They hesitated to advance; but, as the noise did no harm, they entered
through the whitewashed wall and quickly discovered the cause of the
turmoil. Inside were suspended many sheets of tin or thin iron, and
against these metal sheets a row of donkeys were pounding their heels
with vicious kicks.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i072.png"
width="550px"
height="359px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>The shaggy man ran up to the nearest donkey and gave the beast a sharp
blow with his switch.</p>

<p>"Stop that noise!" he shouted; and the donkey stopped kicking the metal
sheet and turned its head to look with surprise at the shaggy man. He
switched the next donkey, and made him stop, and then the next, so that
gradually the rattling of heels ceased and the awful noise subsided. The
donkeys stood in a group and eyed the strangers with fear and trembling.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by making such a racket?" asked the shaggy man,
sternly.</p>

<p>"We were scaring away the foxes," said one of the donkeys, meekly.
"Usually they run fast enough when they hear the noise, which makes them
afraid."</p>

<p>"There are no foxes here," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"I beg to differ with you. There's one, anyhow," replied the donkey,
sitting upright on its haunches and waving a hoof toward Button-Bright.
"We saw him coming and thought the whole army of foxes was marching to
attack us."</p>

<p>"Button-Bright isn't a fox," explained the shaggy man. "He's only
wearing a fox head for a time, until he can get his own head back."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," remarked the donkey, waving its left ear reflectively. "I'm
sorry we made such a mistake, and had all our work and worry for
nothing."</p>

<p>The other donkeys by this time were sitting up and examining the
strangers with big, glassy eyes. They made a queer picture, indeed; for
they wore wide, white collars around their necks and the collars had
many scallops and points. The gentlemen-donkeys wore high pointed caps
set between their great ears, and the lady-donkeys wore sunbonnets with
holes cut in the top for the ears to stick through. But they had no
other clothing except their hairy skins, although many wore gold and
silver bangles on their front wrists and bands of different metals on
their rear ankles. When they were kicking they had braced themselves
with their front legs, but now they all stood or sat upright on their
hind legs and used their front ones as arms. Having no fingers or hands
the beasts were rather clumsy, as you may guess; but Dorothy was
surprised to observe how many things they could do with their stiff,
heavy hoofs.</p>

<p>Some of the donkeys were white, some were brown, or gray, or black, or
spotted; but their hair was sleek and smooth and their broad collars and
caps gave them a neat, if whimsical, appearance.</p>

<p>"This is a nice way to welcome visitors, I must say!" remarked the
shaggy man, in a reproachful tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, we did not mean to be impolite," replied a grey donkey which had
not spoken before. "But you were not expected, nor did you send in your
visiting cards, as it is proper to do."</p>

<p>"There is some truth in that," admitted the shaggy man; "but, now you
are informed that we are important and distinguished travelers, I trust
you will accord us proper consideration."</p>

<p>These big words delighted the donkeys, and made them bow to the shaggy
man with great respect. Said the grey one:</p>

<p>"You shall be taken before his great and glorious Majesty King
Kik-a-bray, who will greet you as becomes your exalted stations."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Dorothy. "Take us to some one who knows
something."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i075.png"

<p>"Oh, we all know something, my child, or we shouldn't be donkeys,"
asserted the grey one, with dignity. "The word 'donkey' means 'clever,'
you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it," she replied. "I thought it meant 'stupid'."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my child. If you will look in the Encyclopedia Donkaniara
you will find I'm correct. But come; I will myself lead you before our
splendid, exalted, and most intellectual ruler."</p>

<p>All donkeys love big words, so it is no wonder the grey one used so many
of them.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i077.png"

alt="The Shaggy Man's Transformation" /></p>

<p>THEY found the houses of the town all low and square and built of
bricks, neatly whitewashed inside and out. The houses were not set in
rows, forming regular streets, but placed here and there in a haphazard
manner which made it puzzling for a stranger to find his way.</p>

<p>"Stupid people must have streets and numbered houses in their cities, to
guide them where to go," observed the grey donkey, as he walked before
the visitors on his hind legs, in an awkward but comical manner; "but
clever donkeys know their way about without such absurd marks. Moreover,
a mixed city is much prettier than one with straight streets."</p>

<p>Dorothy did not agree with this, but she said nothing to contradict it.
Presently she saw a sign on a house that read: "Madam de Fayke,
Hoofist," and she asked their conductor:</p>

<p>"What's a 'hoofist,' please?"</p>

<p>"One who reads your fortune in your hoofs," replied the grey donkey.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said the little girl. "You are quite civilized here."</p>

<p>"Dunkiton," he replied, "is the center of the world's highest
civilization."</p>

<p>They came to a house where two youthful donkeys were whitewashing the
wall, and Dorothy stopped a moment to watch them. They dipped the ends
of their tails, which were much like paint-brushes, into a pail of
whitewash, backed up against the house, and wagged their tails right and
left until the whitewash was rubbed on the wall, after which they dipped
these funny brushes in the pail again and repeated the performance.</p>

<p>"That must be fun," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"No; it's work," replied the old donkey; "but we make our youngsters do
all the whitewashing, to keep them out of mischief."</p>

<p>"Don't they go to school?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"All donkeys are born wise," was the reply, "so the only school we need
is the school of experience. Books are only fit for those who know
nothing, and so are obliged to learn things from other people."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i079.png"
width="550px"
height="351px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"In other words, the more stupid one is the more he thinks he knows,"
observed the shaggy man. The grey donkey paid no attention to this
speech because he had just stopped before a house which had painted over
the doorway a pair of hoofs, with a donkey tail between them and a rude
crown and sceptre above.</p>

<p>"I'll see if his magnificent Majesty King Kik-a-bray is at home," said
he. He lifted his head and called "Whee-haw! whee-haw! whee-haw!" three
times, in a shocking voice, turning about and kicking with his heels
against the panel of the door. For a time there was no reply; then the
door opened far enough to permit a donkey's head to stick out and look
at them.</p>

<p>It was a white head, with big, awful ears and round, solemn eyes.</p>

<p>"Have the foxes gone?" it asked, in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"They haven't been here, most stupendous Majesty," replied the grey one.
"The new arrivals prove to be travelers of distinction."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the King, in a relieved tone of voice. "Let them come in."</p>

<p>He opened the door wide, and the party marched into a big room, which,
Dorothy thought, looked quite unlike a king's palace. There were mats of
woven grasses on the floor and the place was clean and neat; but his
Majesty had no other furniture at all&mdash;perhaps because he didn't need
it. He squatted down in the center of the room and a little brown donkey
ran and brought a big gold crown which it placed on the monarch's head,
and a golden staff with a jeweled ball at the end of it, which the King
held between his front hoofs as he sat upright.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said his Majesty, waving his long ears gently to and fro,
"tell me why you are here, and what you expect me to do for you." He
eyed Button-Bright rather sharply, as if afraid of the little boy's
queer head, though it was the shaggy man who undertook to reply.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i081.png"
width="550px"
height="351px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Most noble and supreme ruler of Dunkiton," he said, trying not to laugh
in the solemn King's face, "we are strangers traveling through your
dominions, and have entered your magnificent city because the road led
through it, and there was no way to go around. All we desire is to pay
our respects to your Majesty&mdash;the cleverest king in all the world, I'm
sure&mdash;and then to continue on our way."</p>

<p>This polite speech pleased the King very much; indeed, it pleased him so
much that it proved an unlucky speech for the shaggy man. Perhaps the
Love Magnet helped to win his Majesty's affection as well as the
flattery, but however this may be the white donkey looked kindly upon
the speaker and said:</p>

<p>"Only a donkey should be able to use such fine, big words, and you are
too wise and admirable in all ways to be a mere man. Also I feel that I
love you as well as I do my own favored people, so I will bestow upon
you the greatest gift within my power&mdash;a donkey's head."</p>

<p>As he spoke he waved his jeweled staff. Although the shaggy man cried
out and tried to leap backward and escape, it proved of no use. Suddenly
his own head was gone and a donkey head appeared in its place&mdash;a brown,
shaggy head so absurd and droll that Dorothy and Polly both broke into
merry laughter, and even Button-Bright's fox face wore a smile.</p>

<p>"Dear me! dear me!" cried the shaggy man, feeling of his shaggy new head
and his long ears. "What a misfortune&mdash;what a great misfortune! Give me
back my own head, you stupid king&mdash;if you love me at all!"</p>

<p>"Don't you like it?" asked the King, surprised.</p>

<p>"Hee-haw! I hate it! Take it away&mdash;quick!" said the shaggy man.</p>

alt="KING KICK-A-BRAY WORKS MAGIC ON THE SHAGGY MAN" /><br />KING KICK-A-BRAY WORKS MAGIC ON THE SHAGGY MAN</p>

<p>"But I can't do that," was the reply. '"My magic works only one way. I
can <i>do</i> things, but I can't <i>un</i> do them. You'll have to find the Truth
Pond, and bathe in its water, in order to get back your own head. But
I advise you not to do that. This head is much more beautiful than the
old one."</p>

<p>"That's a matter of taste," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Where is the Truth Pond?" asked the shaggy man, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the Land of Oz; but just the exact location of it I can
not tell," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Shaggy Man," said Dorothy, smiling because her friend
wagged his new ears so comically. "If the Truth Pond is in Oz we'll be
sure to find it when we get there."</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you going to the Land of Oz?" asked King Kik-a-bray.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied; "but we've been told we are nearer the Land
of Oz than to Kansas, and if that's so the quickest way for me to get
home is to find Ozma."</p>

<p>"Haw-haw! Do you know the mighty Princess Ozma?" asked the King, his
tone both surprised and eager.</p>

<p>"'Course I do; she's my friend," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you'll do me a favor," continued the white donkey, much
excited.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can get me an invitation to Princess Ozma's birthday
celebration, which will be the grandest royal function ever held in
Fairyland. I'd love to go."</p>

<p>"Hee-haw! You deserve punishment, rather than reward, for giving me this
dreadful head," said the shaggy man, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't say 'hee-haw' so much," Polychrome begged him; "it
makes cold chills run down my back."</p>

<p>"But I can't help it, my dear; my donkey head wants to bray
continually," he replied. "Doesn't your fox head want to yelp every
minute?" he asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said the boy, still staring at the shaggy man's ears.
These seemed to interest him greatly, and the sight also made him forget
his own fox head, which was a comfort.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Polly? shall I promise the donkey king an invitation
to Ozma's party?" asked Dorothy of the Rainbow's Daughter, who was
flitting about the room like a sunbeam because she could never keep
still.</p>

<p>"Do as you please, dear," answered Polychrome. "He might help to amuse
the guests of the Princess."</p>

<p>"Then, if you will give us some supper and a place to sleep to-night,
and let us get started on our journey early tomorrow morning," said
Dorothy to the King, "I'll ask Ozma to invite you&mdash;if I happen to get to
Oz."</p>

<p>"Good! Hee-haw! Excellent!" cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased. "You shall
all have fine suppers and good beds. What food would you prefer, a bran
mash or ripe oats in the shell?"</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i086.png"
width="550px"
height="360px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Neither one," replied Dorothy, promptly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps plain hay, or some sweet juicy grass would suit you better,"
suggested Kik-a-bray, musingly.</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to eat?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"What more do you desire?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see we're not donkeys," she explained, "and so we're used to
other food. The foxes gave us a nice supper in Foxville."</p>

<p>"We'd like some dewdrops and mist-cakes," said Polychrome.</p>

<p>"I'd prefer apples and a ham sandwich," declared the shaggy man; "for
although I've a donkey head I still have my own particular stomach."</p>

<p>"I want pie," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I think some beefsteak and chocolate layer-cake would taste best," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Hee-haw! I declare!" exclaimed the King. "It seems each one of you
wants a different food. How queer all living creatures are, except
donkeys!"</p>

<p>"And donkeys like you are queerest of all," laughed Polychrome.</p>

<p>"Well," decided the King, "I suppose my Magic Staff will produce the
things you crave; if you are lacking in good taste it is not my fault."</p>

<p>With this he waved his staff with the jeweled ball, and before them
instantly appeared a tea-table, set with linen and pretty dishes, and on
the table were the very things each had wished for. Dorothy's beefsteak
was smoking hot, and the shaggy man's apples were plump and
rosy-cheeked. The King had not thought to provide chairs, so they all
stood in their places around the table and ate with good appetite, being
hungry. The Rainbow's Daughter found three tiny dewdrops on a crystal
plate, and Button-Bright had a big slice of apple-pie, which he devoured
eagerly.</p>

<p>Afterward the King called the brown donkey, which was his favorite
servant, and bade it lead his guests to the vacant house where they
were to pass the night. It had only one room and no furniture except
beds of clean straw and a few mats of woven grasses; but our travelers
were contented with these simple things because they realized it was the
best the Donkey-King had to offer them. As soon as it was dark they lay
down on the mats and slept comfortably until morning.</p>

<p>At daybreak there was a dreadful noise throughout the city. Every donkey
in the place brayed. When he heard this the shaggy man woke up and
called out "Hee-haw!" as loud as he could.</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i088.png"
width="550px"
height="354px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Stop that!" said Button-Bright, in a cross voice. Both Dorothy and
Polly looked at the shaggy man reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it, my dears," he said, as if ashamed of his bray; "but
I'll try not to do it again."</p>

<p>Of course they forgave him, for as he still had the Love Magnet in his
pocket they were all obliged to love him as much as ever.</p>

<p>They did not see the King again, but Kik-a-bray remembered them; for a
table appeared again in their room with the same food upon it as on the
night before.</p>

<p>"Don't want pie for breakfus'," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I'll give you some of my beefsteak," proposed Dorothy; "there's plenty
for us all."</p>

<p>That suited the boy better, but the shaggy man said he was content with
his apples and sandwiches, although he ended the meal by eating
Button-Bright's pie. Polly liked her dewdrops and mist-cakes better than
any other food, so they all enjoyed an excellent breakfast. Toto had the
scraps left from the beefsteak, and he stood up nicely on his hind legs
while Dorothy fed them to him.</p>

<p>Breakfast ended, they passed through the village to the side opposite
that by which they had entered, the brown servant-donkey guiding them
through the maze of scattered houses. There was the road again, leading
far away into the unknown country beyond.</p>

<p>"King Kik-a-bray says you must not forget his invitation," said the
brown donkey, as they passed through the opening in the wall.</p>

<p>"I shan't," promised Dorothy.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i090.png"
width="550px"
height="276px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Perhaps no one ever beheld a more strangely assorted group than the one
which now walked along the road, through pretty green fields and past
groves of feathery pepper-trees and fragrant mimosa. Polychrome, her
beautiful gauzy robes floating around her like a rainbow cloud, went
first, dancing back and forth and darting now here to pluck a
wild-flower or there to watch a beetle crawl across the path. Toto ran
after her at times, barking joyously the while, only to become sober
again and trot along at Dorothy's heels. The little Kansas girl walked
holding Button-Bright's hand clasped in her own, and the wee boy with
his fox head covered by the sailor hat presented an odd appearance.
Strangest of all, perhaps, was the shaggy man, with his shaggy donkey
head, who shuffled along in the rear with his hands thrust deep in his
big pockets.</p>

<p>None of the party was really unhappy. All were straying in an unknown
land and had suffered more or less annoyance and discomfort; but they
realized they were having a fairy adventure in a fairy country, and were
much interested in finding out what would happen next.</p>

<p>ABOUT the middle of the forenoon they began to go up a long hill.
By-and-by this hill suddenly dropped down into a pretty valley, where
the travelers saw to their surprise, a small house standing by the
roadside.</p>

<p>It was the first house they had seen, and they hastened into the valley
to discover who lived there. No one was in sight as they approached, but
when they began to get nearer the house they heard queer sounds coming
from it. They could not make these out at first, but as they became
louder our friends thought they heard a sort of music like that made by
a wheezy hand-organ; the music fell upon their ears in this way:</p>

<p class="c"><i>Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom!</i><br />
<i>Oom, pom-pom! oom, pom-pom!</i><br />
<i>Tiddle-tiddle-tiddle, oom pom-pom!</i><br />
<i>Oom, pom-pom&mdash;pah!</i></p>

<p>"What is it, a band or a mouth-organ?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Sounds to me like a played-out phonograph," said the shaggy man,
lifting his enormous ears to listen.</p>

<p>"Oh, there just <i>couldn't</i> be a funnygraf in Fairyland!" cried Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It's rather pretty, isn't it?" asked Polychrome, trying to dance to the
strains.</p>

<p class="c"><i>Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,</i><br />
<i>Oom pom-pom; oom pom-pom!</i></p>

<p class="non">came the music to their ears, more distinctly as they drew nearer the
house. Presently they saw a little fat man sitting on a bench before the
door. He wore a red, braided jacket that reached to his waist, a blue
waistcoat, and white trousers with gold stripes down the sides. On his
bald head was perched a little, round, red cap held in place by a rubber
elastic underneath his chin. His face was round, his eyes a faded blue,
and he wore white cotton gloves. The man leaned on a stout gold-headed
cane, bending forward on his seat to watch his visitors approach.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i094.png"
width="550px"
height="349px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Singularly enough, the musical sounds they had heard seemed to come from
the inside of the fat man himself; for he was playing no instrument nor
was any to be seen near him.</p>

<p>They came up and stood in a row, staring at him, and he stared back
while the queer sounds came from him as before:</p>

<p class="c"><i>Tiddle-iddle-iddle, oom pom-pom,</i><br />
<i>Oom, pom-pom; oom pom-pom!</i><br />
<i>Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,</i><br />
<i>Oom, pom-pom&mdash;pah!</i></p>

<p>"Why, he's a reg'lar musicker!" said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"What's a musicker?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Him!" said the boy.</p>

<p>Hearing this the fat man sat up a little stiffer than before, as if he
had received a compliment, and still came the sounds:</p>

<p class="c"><i>Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,</i><br />
<i>Oom pom-pom, oom&mdash;&mdash; </i></p>

<p>"Stop it!" cried the shaggy man, earnestly. "Stop that dreadful noise!"</p>

<p>The fat man looked at him sadly and began his reply. When he spoke the
music changed and the words seemed to accompany the notes. He said&mdash;or
rather sang:</p>

<p class="c"><i>It isn't a noise that you hear,</i><br />
<i>But Music, harmonic and clear.</i><br />
<i>My breath makes me play</i><br />
<i>Like an organ, all day&mdash;</i><br />
<i>That bass note is in my left ear.</i></p>

<p>"How funny!" exclaimed Dorothy; "he says his breath makes the music."</p>

<p>"That's all nonsense," declared the shaggy man; but now the music began
again, and they all listened carefully.</p>

<p class="c"><i>My lungs are full of reeds like those</i><br />
<i>In organs, therefore I suppose,</i><br />
<i>If I breathe in or out my nose,</i><br />
<i>The reeds are bound to play.</i></p>

<p class="c"><i>So, as I breathe to live, you know,</i><br />
<i>I squeeze out music as I go;</i><br />
<i>I'm very sorry this is so&mdash;&mdash; </i><br />
<i>Forgive my piping, pray!</i>
</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i096.png"
width="550px"
height="351px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Poor man," said Polychrome; "he can't help it. What a great misfortune
it is!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the shaggy man; "we are only obliged to hear this music a
short time, until we leave him and go away; but the poor fellow must
listen to himself as long as he lives, and that is enough to drive him
crazy. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright. Toto said "Bow-wow!" and the others
laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's why he lives all alone," suggested Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Yes; if he had neighbors they might do him an injury," responded the
shaggy man.</p>

<p>All this while the little fat musicker was breathing the notes:</p>

<p class="c"><i>Tiddle-tiddle-iddle, oom, pom-pom,</i></p>

<p class="non">and they had to speak loud in order to hear themselves. The shaggy man
said:</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>The reply came in the shape of this sing-song:</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>I'm Allegro da Capo, a very famous man;</i><br />
<i>Just find another, high or low, to match me if you can.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Some people try, but can't, to play</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And have to practice every day;</i></span><br />
<i>But I've been musical alway, since first my life began.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Why, I b'lieve he's proud of it," exclaimed Dorothy, "and seems to me
I've heard worse music than he makes."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I've forgotten, just now. But Mr. Da Capo is certainly a strange
person&mdash;isn't he?&mdash;and p'r'aps he's the only one of his kind in all the
world."</p>

<p>This praise seemed to please the little fat musicker, for he swelled out
his chest, looked important and sang as follows:</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>I wear no band around me,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And yet I am a band!</i></span><br />
<i>I do not strain to make my strains</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>But, on the other hand,</i></span><br />
<i>My toot is always destitute</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Of flats or other errors;</i></span><br />
<i>To see sharp and be natural are</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>For me but minor terrors.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand that," said Polychrome, with a puzzled look;
"but perhaps it's because I'm accustomed only to the music of the
spheres."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Oh, Polly means the atmosphere and hemisphere, I s'pose," explained
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow!" said Toto.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i099.png"
width="550px"
height="349px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>But the musicker was still breathing his constant</p>

<p class="c"><i>Oom, pom-pom; oom, pom-pom&mdash;&mdash; </i></p>

<p class="non">and it seemed to jar on the shaggy man's nerves.</p>

<p>"Stop it, can't you?" he cried, angrily; "or breathe in a whisper; or
put a clothes-pin on your nose. Do something, anyhow!"</p>

<p>But the fat one, with a sad look, sang this answer:</p>

<p class="poem">
"<i>Music hath charms, and it may</i><br />
<i>Soothe even the savage, they say;</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>So if savage you feel</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Just list to my reel,</i></span><br />
<i>For sooth to say that's the real way."</i><br />
</p>

<p>The shaggy man had to laugh at this, and when he laughed he stretched
his donkey mouth wide open. Said Dorothy:</p>

<p>"I don't know how good his poetry is, but it seems to fit the notes, so
that's all that can be 'xpected."</p>

<p>"I like it," said Button-Bright, who was staring hard at the musicker,
his little legs spread wide apart. To the surprise of his companions,
the boy asked this long question:</p>

<p>"If I swallowed a mouth-organ, what would I be?"</p>

<p>"An organette," said the shaggy man. "But come, my dears; I think the
best thing we can do is to continue on our journey before Button-Bright
swallows anything. We must try to find that Land of Oz, you know."</p>

<p>Hearing this speech the musicker sang, quickly:</p>

<p class="c"><i>If you go to the hand of Oz</i><br />
<i>Please take me along, because</i><br />
<i>On Ozma's birthday</i><br />
<i>I'm anxious to play</i><br />
<i>The loveliest song ever was.</i></p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Dorothy; "we prefer to travel alone. But if I see
Ozma I'll tell her you want to come to her birthday party."</p>

<p>"Let's be going," urged the shaggy man, anxiously.</p>

<p>Polly was already dancing along the road, far in advance, and the
others turned to follow her. Toto did not like the fat musicker and made
a grab for his chubby leg. Dorothy quickly caught up the growling little
dog and hurried after her companions, who were walking faster than usual
in order to get out of hearing. They had to climb a hill, and until they
got to the top they could not escape the musicker's monotonous piping:</p>

<p class="c"><i>"Oom, pom-pom; oom, pom-pom;</i><br />
<i>Tiddle-iddle-widdle, oom, pom-pom;</i><br />
<i>Oom, pom-pom&mdash;pah!"</i></p>

<p>As they passed the brow of the hill, however, and descended on the other
side, the sounds gradually died away, whereat they all felt much
relieved.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't have to live with the organ-man; aren't you, Polly?"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," answered the Rainbow's Daughter.</p>

<p>"He's nice," declared Button-Bright, soberly.</p>

<p>"I hope your Princess Ozma won't invite him to her birthday
celebration," remarked the shaggy man; "for the fellow's music would
drive her guests all crazy. You've given me an idea, Button-Bright; I
believe the musicker must have swallowed an accordeon in his youth."</p>

<p>"What's 'cordeon?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"It's a kind of pleating," explained Dorothy, putting down the dog.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow!" said Toto, and ran away at a mad gallop to chase a
bumble-bee.</p>

<p>THE country wasn't so pretty now. Before the travelers appeared a rocky
plain covered with hills on which grew nothing green. They were nearing
some low mountains, too, and the road, which before had been smooth and
pleasant to walk upon, grew rough and uneven.</p>

<p>Button-Bright's little feet stumbled more than once, and Polychrome
ceased her dancing because the walking was now so difficult that she had
no trouble to keep warm.</p>

<p>It had become afternoon, yet there wasn't a thing for their luncheon
except two apples which the shaggy man had taken from the breakfast
table. He divided these into four pieces and gave a portion to each of
his companions. Dorothy and Button-Bright were glad to get theirs; but
Polly was satisfied with a small bite, and Toto did not like apples.</p>

<p>"Do you know," asked the Rainbow's Daughter, "if this is the right road
to the Emerald City?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Dorothy; "but it's the only road in this part of
the country, so we may as well go to the end of it."</p>

<p>"It looks now as if it might end pretty soon," remarked the shaggy man;
"and what shall we do if it does?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"If I had my Magic Belt," replied Dorothy, thoughtfully, "it could do us
a lot of good just now."</p>

<p>"What is your Magic Belt?" asked Polychrome.</p>

<p>"It's a thing I captured from the Nome King one day, and it can do 'most
any wonderful thing. But I left it with Ozma, you know; 'cause magic
won't work in Kansas, but only in fairy countries."</p>

<p>"Is this a fairy country?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd know," said the little girl, gravely. "If it
wasn't a fairy country you couldn't have a fox head and the shaggy man
couldn't have a donkey head, and the Rainbow's Daughter would be
invis'ble."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to know anything, Button-Bright. Invis'ble is a thing
you can't see."</p>

<p>"Then Toto's invisible," declared the boy, and Dorothy found he was
right. Toto had disappeared from view, but they could hear him barking
furiously among the heaps of grey rock ahead of them.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i105.png"
width="550px"
height="368px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>They moved forward a little faster to see what the dog was barking at,
and found perched upon a point of rock by the roadside a curious
creature. It had the form of a man, middle-sized and rather slender and
graceful; but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they could
see that its face was black as ink, and it wore a black cloth costume
made like a union suit and fitting tight to its skin. Its hands were
black, too, and its toes curled down, like a bird's. The creature was
black all over except its hair, which was fine, and yellow, banged in
front across the black forehead and cut close at the sides. The eyes,
which were fixed steadily upon the barking dog, were small and sparkling
and looked like the eyes of a weasel.</p>

<p>"What in the world do you s'pose that is?" asked Dorothy in a hushed
voice, as the little group of travelers stood watching the strange
creature.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>The thing gave a jump and turned half around, sitting in the same place
but with the other side of its body facing them. Instead of being black,
it was now pure white, with a face like that of a clown in a circus and
hair of a brilliant purple. The creature could bend either way, and its
white toes now curled the same way the black ones on the other side had
done.</p>

<p>"It has a face both front and back," whispered Dorothy, wonderingly;
"only there's no back at all, but two fronts."</p>

<p>Having made the turn, the being sat motionless as before, while Toto
barked louder at the white man than he had done at the black one.</p>

<p>"Once," said the shaggy man, "I had a jumping-jack like that, with two
faces."</p>

<p>"Was it alive?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"No," replied the shaggy man; "it worked on strings, and was made of
wood."</p>

<p>"Wonder if this works with strings," said Dorothy; but Polychrome cried
"Look!" for another creature just like the first had suddenly appeared
sitting on another rock, its black side toward them. The two twisted
their heads around and showed a black face on the white side of one and
a white face on the black side of the other.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i107.png"
width="550px"
height="361px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"How curious," said Polychrome; "and how loose their heads seem to be!
Are they friendly to us, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell, Polly," replied Dorothy. "Let's ask 'em."</p>

<p>The creatures flopped first one way and then the other, showing black or
white by turns; and now another joined them, appearing on another rock.
Our friends had come to a little hollow in the hills, and the place
where they now stood was surrounded by jagged peaks of rock, except
where the road ran through.</p>

<p>"Now there are four of them," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"Five," declared Polychrome.</p>

<p>"Six," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Lots of 'em!" cried Button-Bright; and so there were&mdash;quite a row of
the two-sided black and white creatures sitting on the rocks all around.</p>

<p>Toto stopped barking and ran between Dorothy's feet, where he crouched
down as if afraid. The creatures did not look pleasant or friendly, to
be sure, and the shaggy man's donkey face became solemn, indeed.</p>

<p>"Ask 'em who they are, and what they want," whispered Dorothy; so the
shaggy man called out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Scoodlers!" they yelled in chorus, their voices sharp and shrill.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" called the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"You!" they yelled, pointing their thin fingers at the group; and they
all flopped around, so they were white, and then all flopped back again,
so they were black.</p>

<p>"But what do you want us for?" asked the shaggy man, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Soup!" they all shouted, as if with one voice.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i109.png"
style="border:double black 10px;"
width="550px"
height="784px"
alt="&quot;YOU!&quot; THEY YELLED" /><br />"YOU!" THEY YELLED</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" said Dorothy, trembling a little; "the Scoodlers must be
reg'lar cannibals."</p>

<p>"Don't want to be soup," protested Button-Bright, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," said the little girl, trying to comfort him; "we don't any
of us want to be soup. But don't worry; the shaggy man will take care of
us."</p>

<p>"Will he?" asked Polychrome, who did not like the Scoodlers at all, and
kept close to Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I'll try," promised the shaggy man; but he looked worried.</p>

<p>Happening just then to feel the Love Magnet in his pocket, he said to
the creatures, with more confidence:</p>

<p>"Don't you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" they shouted, all together.</p>

<p>"Then you mustn't harm me, or my friends," said the shaggy man, firmly.</p>

<p>"We love you in soup!" they yelled, and in a flash turned their white
sides to the front.</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" said Dorothy. "This is a time, Shaggy Man, when you get
loved too much."</p>

<p>"Don't want to be soup!" wailed Button-Bright again; and Toto began to
whine dismally, as if he didn't want to be soup, either.</p>

<p>"The only thing to do," said the shaggy man to his friends, in a low
tone, "is to get out of this pocket in the rocks as soon as we can, and
leave the Scoodlers behind us. Follow me, my dears, and don't pay any
attention to what they do or say."</p>

<p>With this he began to march along the road to the opening in the rocks
ahead, and the others kept close behind him. But the Scoodlers closed up
in front, as if to bar their way, and so the shaggy man stooped down and
picked up a loose stone, which he threw at the creatures to scare them
from the path.</p>

<p>At this the Scoodlers raised a howl. Two of them picked their heads from
their shoulders and hurled them at the shaggy man with such force that
he fell over in a heap, greatly astonished. The two now ran forward with
swift leaps, caught up their heads, and put them on again, after which
they sprang back to their positions on the rocks.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i112.png"

alt="Escaping the Soup-kettle" /></p>

<p>THE shaggy man got up and felt of himself to see if he was hurt; but he
was not. One of the heads had struck his breast and the other his left
shoulder; yet though they had knocked him down the heads were not hard
enough to bruise him.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, firmly; "we've got to get out of here some way," and
forward he started again.</p>

<p>The Scoodlers began yelling and throwing their heads in great numbers at
our frightened friends. The shaggy man was knocked over again, and so
was Button-Bright, who kicked his heels against the ground and howled as
loud as he could, although he was not hurt a bit. One head struck Toto,
who first yelped and then grabbed the head by an ear and started running
away with it.</p>

<p>The Scoodlers who had thrown their heads began to scramble down and run
to pick them up, with wonderful quickness; but the one whose head Toto
had stolen found it hard to get it back again. The head couldn't see the
body with either pair of its eyes, because the dog was in the way, so
the headless Scoodler stumbled around over the rocks and tripped on them
more than once in its effort to regain its top. Toto was trying to get
outside the rocks and roll the head down the hill; but some of the other
Scoodlers came to the rescue of their unfortunate comrade and pelted the
dog with their own heads until he was obliged to drop his burden and
hurry back to Dorothy.</p>

<p>The little girl and the Rainbow's Daughter had both escaped the shower
of heads, but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away
from the dreadful Scoodlers.</p>

<p>"We may as well submit," declared the shaggy man, in a rueful voice, as
he got upon his feet again. He turned toward their foes and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do?"</p>

<p>"Come!" they cried, in a triumphant chorus, and at once sprang from the
rocks and surrounded their captives on all sides. One funny thing about
the Scoodlers was they could walk in either direction, coming or going,
without turning around; because they had two faces and, as Dorothy
said, "two front sides," and their feet were shaped like the letter T
upside down
(<img src="images/i00t.png" alt="image of upside-down letter T" />). They moved with great rapidity and
there was something about their glittering eyes and contrasting colors
and removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror, and
made them long to escape.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i114.png"
width="550px"
height="355px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>But the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road,
down the hill by a side path until they came before a low mountain of
rock that looked like a huge bowl turned upside down. At the edge of
this mountain was a deep gulf&mdash;so deep that when you looked into it
there was nothing but blackness below. Across the gulf was a narrow
bridge of rock, and at the other end of the bridge was an arched opening
that led into the mountain.</p>

<p>Over this bridge the Scoodlers led their prisoners, through the opening
into the mountain, which they found to be an immense hollow dome lighted
by several holes in the roof. All around the circular space were built
rock houses, set close together, each with a door in the front wall.
None of these houses was more than six feet wide, but the Scoodlers were
thin people sidewise and did not need much room. So vast was the dome
that there was a large space in the middle of the cave, in front of all
these houses, where the creatures might congregate as in a great hall.</p>

<p>It made Dorothy shudder to see a huge iron kettle suspended by a stout
chain in the middle of the place, and underneath the kettle a great heap
of kindling wood and shavings, ready to light.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the shaggy man, drawing back as they approached
this place, so that they were forced to push him forward.</p>

<p>"The Soup Kettle!" yelled the Scoodlers; and then they shouted in the
next breath:</p>

<p>"We're hungry!"</p>

<p>Button-Bright, holding Dorothy's hand in one chubby fist and Polly's
hand in the other, was so affected by this shout that he began to cry
again, repeating the protest:</p>

<p>"Don't want to be soup, I don't!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the shaggy man, consolingly; "I ought to make enough
soup to feed them all, I'm so big; so I'll ask them to put me in the
kettle first."</p>

<p>"All right," said Button-Bright, more cheerfully.</p>

<p>But the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet. They led the captives
into a house at the farthest side of the cave&mdash;a house somewhat wider
than the others.</p>

<p>"Who lives here?" asked the Rainbow's Daughter. The Scoodlers nearest
her replied:</p>

<p>"The Queen."</p>

<p>It made Dorothy hopeful to learn that a woman ruled over these fierce
creatures, but a moment later they were ushered by two or three of the
escort into a gloomy, bare room&mdash;and her hope died away.</p>

<p>For the Queen of the Scoodlers proved to be much more dreadful in
appearance than any of her people. One side of her was fiery red, with
jet-black hair and green eyes and the other side of her was bright
yellow, with crimson hair and black eyes. She wore a short skirt of red
and yellow and her hair, instead of being banged, was a tangle of short
curls upon which rested a circular crown of silver&mdash;much dented and
twisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so many
times. Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply
wrinkled.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" asked the Queen, sharply, as our friends were made
to stand before her.</p>

<p>"Soup!" cried the guard of Scoodlers, speaking together.</p>

<p>"We're not!" said Dorothy, indignantly; "we're nothing of the sort."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i117.png"
width="550px"
height="351px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Ah, but you will be soon," retorted the Queen, a grim smile making her
look more dreadful than before.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, most beautiful vision," said the shaggy man, bowing before
the queen politely. "I must request your Serene Highness to let us go
our way without being made into soup. For I own the Love Magnet, and
whoever meets me must love me and all my friends."</p>

<p>"True," replied the Queen. "We love you very much; so much that we
intend to eat your broth with real pleasure. But tell me, do you think I
am so beautiful?"</p>

<p>"You won't be at all beautiful if you eat me," he said, shaking his head
sadly. "Handsome is as handsome does, you know."</p>

<p>The Queen turned to Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> think I'm beautiful?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said the boy; "you're ugly."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think you're a fright," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"If you could see yourself you'd be terribly scared," added Polly.</p>

<p>The Queen scowled at them and flopped from her red side to her yellow
side.</p>

<p>"Take them away," she commanded the guard, "and at six o'clock run them
through the meat chopper and start the soup kettle boiling. And put
plenty of salt in the broth this time, or I'll punish the cooks
severely."</p>

<p>"Any onions, your Majesty?" asked one of the guard.</p>

<p>"Plenty of onions and garlic and a dash of red pepper. Now, go!"</p>

<p>The Scoodlers led the captives away and shut them up in one of the
houses, leaving only a single Scoodler to keep guard.</p>

<p>The place was a sort of store-house; containing bags of potatoes and
baskets of carrots, onions, and turnips.</p>

<p>"These," said their guard, pointing to the vegetables, "we use to flavor
our soups with."</p>

<p>The prisoners were rather disheartened by this time, for they saw no way
to escape and did not know how soon it would be six o'clock and time for
the meat-chopper to begin work. But the shaggy man was brave and did not
intend to submit to such a horrid fate without a struggle.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fight for our lives," he whispered to the children, "for
if I fail we will be no worse off than before, and to sit here quietly
until we are made into soup would be foolish and cowardly."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i119.png"
width="550px"
height="362px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>The Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway, turning first his white
side toward them and then his black side, as if he wanted to show to all
of his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners. The captives
sat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the room&mdash;except
Polychrome, who danced back and forth in the little place to keep
herself warm, for she felt the chill of the cave. Whenever she
approached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear, and
Polly would nod her pretty head as if she understood.</p>

<p>The shaggy man told Dorothy and Button-Bright to stand before him while
he emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks. When this had been
secretly done little Polychrome, dancing near to the guard, suddenly
reached out her hand and slapped his face, the next instant whirling
away from him quickly to rejoin her friends.</p>

<p>The angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the
Rainbow's Daughter; but the shaggy man was expecting that, and caught
the head very neatly, putting it in the sack, which he tied at the
mouth. The body of the guard, not having the eyes of its head to guide
it, ran here and there in an aimless manner, and the shaggy man easily
dodged it and opened the door. Fortunately there was no one in the big
cave at that moment, so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as they
could for the entrance, and out across the narrow bridge.</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i121.png"

height="782px"
alt="THE SHAGGY MAN CAUGHT THE HEADS AND TOSSED THEM INTO THE
GULF BELOW" /><br />THE SHAGGY MAN CAUGHT THE HEADS AND TOSSED THEM INTO THE
GULF BELOW</p>

<p>"I'll carry Button-Bright," he said, for he knew the little boy's legs
were too short to run fast.</p>

<p>Dorothy picked up Toto, and then seized Polly's hand and ran swiftly
toward the entrance to the cave. The shaggy man perched Button-Bright on
his shoulders and ran after them. They moved so quickly and their escape
was so wholly unexpected that they had almost reached the bridge when
one of the Scoodlers looked out of his house and saw them.</p>

<p>The creature raised a shrill cry that brought all its fellows bounding
out of the numerous doors, and at once they started in chase. Dorothy
and Polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the Scoodlers began
throwing their heads. One of the queer missiles struck the shaggy man on
his back and nearly knocked him over; but he was at the mouth of the
cave now, so he set down Button-Bright and told the boy to run across
the bridge to Dorothy.</p>

<p>Then the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies, standing just
outside the opening, and as fast as they threw their heads at him he
caught them and tossed them into the black gulf below. The headless
bodies of the foremost Scoodlers kept the others from running close up,
but they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping
prisoners. The shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down
into the black gulf. Among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head
of the Queen, and this he tossed after the others with right good will.</p>

<p>Presently every Scoodler of the lot had thrown its head, and every head
was down in the deep gulf, and now the helpless bodies of the creatures
were mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt
to discover what had become of their heads. The shaggy man laughed and
walked across the bridge to rejoin his companions.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i123.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"It's lucky I learned to play base-ball when I was young," he remarked,
"for I caught all those heads easily, and never missed one. But come
along, little ones; the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else
any more."</p>

<p>Button-Bright was still frightened and kept insisting, "I don't want to
be soup!" for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy could
not realize they were free and safe. But the shaggy man assured him that
all danger of their being made into soup was now past, as the Scoodlers
would be unable to eat soup for some time to come.</p>

<p>So now, anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as
possible, they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just
beyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers; and you may be
sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again.</p>

<p>"IT'S getting awful rough walking," said Dorothy, as they trudged along.
Button-Bright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry. Indeed, all were
hungry, and thirsty, too; for they had eaten nothing but the apples
since breakfast; so their steps lagged and they grew silent and weary.
At last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and saw
before them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their feet.
An agreeable fragrance was wafted toward them.</p>

<p>Our travelers, hot and tired, ran forward on beholding this refreshing
sight and were not long in coming to the trees. Here they found a spring
of pure bubbling water, around which the grass was full of wild
strawberry plants, their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat. Some
of the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears, so the hungry
adventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to eat and to
drink.</p>

<p>They lost no time in picking the biggest strawberries and ripest oranges
and soon had feasted to their hearts' content. Walking beyond the line
of trees they saw before them a fearful, dismal desert, everywhere grey
sand. At the edge of this awful waste was a large white sign with black
letters neatly painted upon it; and the letters made these words:</p>

<p>"Oh," said Dorothy, when the shaggy man had read this sign aloud; "I've
seen this desert before, and it's true no one can live who tries to walk
upon the sands."</p>

<p>"Then we mustn't try it," answered the shaggy man, thoughtfully. "But as
we can't go ahead and there's no use going back, what shall we do
next?"</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i127.png"

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, either," added Dorothy, despondently.</p>

<p>"I wish father would come for me," sighed the pretty Rainbow's Daughter,
"I would take you all to live upon the rainbow, where you could dance
along its rays from morning till night, without a care or worry of any
sort. But I suppose father's too busy just now to search the world for
me."</p>

<p>"Don't want to dance," said Button-Bright, sitting down wearily upon the
soft grass.</p>

<p>"It's very good of you, Polly," said Dorothy; "but there are other
things that would suit me better than dancing on rainbows. I'm 'fraid
they'd be kind of soft an' squnshy under foot, anyhow, although they're
so pretty to look at."</p>

<p>This didn't help to solve the problem, and they all fell silent and
looked at one another questioningly.</p>

<p>"Really, I don't know what to do," muttered the shaggy man, gazing hard
at Toto; and the little dog wagged his tail and said "Bow-wow!" just as
if he could not tell, either, what to do. Button-Bright got a stick and
began to dig in the earth, and the others watched him for a while in
deep thought. Finally the shaggy man said:</p>

<p>"It's nearly evening, now; so we may well sleep in this pretty place and
get rested; perhaps by morning we can decide what is best to be done."</p>

<p>There was little chance to make beds for the children, but the leaves of
the trees grew thickly and would serve to keep off the night dews, so
the shaggy man piled soft grasses in the thickest shade and when it was
dark they lay down and slept peacefully until morning.</p>

<p>Long after the others were asleep, however, the shaggy man sat in the
starlight by the spring, gazing thoughtfully into its bubbling waters.
Suddenly he smiled and nodded to himself as if he had found a good
thought, after which he, too, laid himself down under a tree and was
soon lost in slumber.</p>

<p>In the bright morning sunshine, as they ate of the strawberries and
sweet juicy pears, Dorothy said:</p>

<p>"Polly, can you do any magic?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," answered Polychrome, shaking her dainty head.</p>

<p>"You ought to know <i>some</i> magic, being the Rainbow's Daughter,"
continued Dorothy, earnestly.</p>

<p>"But we who live on the rainbow among the fleecy clouds have no use for
magic," replied Polychrome.</p>

<p>"What I'd like," said Dorothy, "is to find some way to cross the desert
to the Land of Oz and its Emerald City. I've crossed it already, you
know, more than once. First a cyclone carried my house over, and some
Silver Shoes brought me back again&mdash;in half a second. Then Ozma took me
over on her Magic Carpet, and the Nome King's Magic Belt took me home
that time. You see it was magic that did it every time 'cept the first,
and we can't 'spect a cyclone to happen along and take us to the Emerald
City now."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," returned Polly, with a shudder; "I hate cyclones, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's why I wanted to find out if you could do any magic," said the
little Kansas girl. "I'm sure I can't; and I'm sure Button-Bright can't;
and the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet, which won't
help us much."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, my dear," spoke the shaggy man, a smile on
his donkey face. "I may not be able to do magic myself, but I can call
to us a powerful friend who loves me because I own the Love Magnet, and
this friend surely will be able to help us."</p>

<p>"Who is your friend?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Johnny Dooit."</p>

<p>"What can Johnny do?"</p>

<p>"Anything," answered the shaggy man, with confidence.</p>

<p>"Ask him to come," she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

<p>The shaggy man took the Love Magnet from his pocket and unwrapped the
paper that surrounded it. Holding the charm in the palm of his hand he
looked at it steadily and said these words:</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>"Dear Johnny Dooit, come to me.</i><br />
<i>I need you bad as bad can be."</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," said a cheery little voice; "but you shouldn't say
you need me bad, 'cause I'm always, <i>always</i> good."</p>

<p>At this they quickly whirled around to find a funny little man sitting
on a big copper chest, puffing smoke from a long pipe. His hair was
grey, his whiskers were grey; and these whiskers were so long that he
had wound the ends of them around his waist and tied them in a hard knot
underneath the leather apron that reached from his chin nearly to his
feet, and which was soiled and scratched as if it had been used a long
time. His nose was broad, and stuck up a little; but his eyes were
twinkling and merry. The little man's hands and arms were as hard and
tough as the leather in his apron, and Dorothy thought Johnny Dooit
looked as if he had done a lot of hard work in his lifetime.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i132.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Good morning, Johnny," said the shaggy man. "Thank you for coming to me
so quickly."</p>

<p>"I never waste time," said the newcomer, promptly. "But what's happened
to you? Where did you get that donkey head? Really, I wouldn't have
known you at all, Shaggy Man, if I hadn't looked at your feet."</p>

<p>The shaggy man introduced Johnny Dooit to Dorothy and Toto and
Button-Bright and the Rainbow's Daughter, and told him the story of
their adventures, adding that they were anxious now to reach the Emerald
City in the Land of Oz, where Dorothy had friends who would take care of
them and send them safe home again.</p>

<p>"But," said he, "we find that we can't cross this desert, which turns
all living flesh that touches it into dust; so I have asked you to come
and help us."</p>

<p>Johnny Dooit puffed his pipe and looked carefully at the dreadful desert
in front of them&mdash;stretching so far away they could not see its end.</p>

<p>"You must ride," he said, briskly.</p>

<p>"What in?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"In a sand-boat, which has runners like a sled and sails like a ship.
The wind will blow you swiftly across the desert and the sand cannot
touch your flesh to turn it into dust."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Dorothy, clapping her hands delightedly. "That was the way
the Magic Carpet took us across. We didn't have to touch the horrid sand
at all."</p>

<p>"But where is the sand-boat?" asked the shaggy man, looking all around
him.</p>

<p>"I'll make you one," said Johnny Dooit.</p>

<p>As he spoke he knocked the ashes from his pipe and put it in his pocket.
Then he unlocked the copper chest and lifted the lid, and Dorothy saw
it was full of shining tools of all sorts and shapes.</p>

<p>Johnny Dooit moved quickly now&mdash;so quickly that they were astonished at
the work he was able to accomplish. He had in his chest a tool for
everything he wanted to do, and these must have been magic tools because
they did their work so fast and so well.</p>

<p>The man hummed a little song as he worked, and Dorothy tried to listen
to it. She thought the words were something like these:</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>The only way to do a thing</i><br />
<i>Is do it when you can,</i><br />
<i>And do it cheerfully, and sing</i><br />
<i>And work and think and plan.</i><br />
<i>The only real unhappy one</i><br />
<i>Is he who dares to shirk;</i><br />
<i>The only really happy one</i><br />
<i>Is he who cares to work.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Whatever Johnny Dooit was singing he was certainly doing things, and
they all stood by and watched him in amazement.</p>

<p>He seized an axe and in a couple of chops felled a tree. Next he took a
saw and in a few minutes sawed the tree-trunk into broad long boards. He
then nailed the boards together into the shape of a boat, about twelve
feet long and four feet wide. He cut from another tree a long, slender
pole which, when trimmed of its branches and fastened upright in the
center of the boat, served as a mast. From the chest he drew a coil of
rope and a big bundle of canvas, and with these&mdash;still humming his
song&mdash;he rigged up a sail, arranging it so it could be raised or lowered
upon the mast.</p>

<p>Dorothy fairly gasped with wonder to see the thing grow so speedily
before her eyes, and both Button-Bright and Polly looked on with the
same absorbed interest.</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i135.png"
width="550px"
height="352px"
alt="image not available" /></p>


<p>"It ought to be painted," said Johnny Dooit, tossing his tools back into
the chest, "for that would make it look prettier. But 'though I can
paint it for you in three seconds it would take an hour to dry, and
that's a waste of time."</p>

<p>"We don't care how it looks," said the shaggy man, "if only it will take
us across the desert."</p>

<p>"It will do that," declared Johnny Dooit. "All you need worry about is
tipping over. Did you ever sail a ship?"</p>

<p>"I've seen one sailed," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"Good. Sail this boat the way you've seen a ship sailed, and you'll be
across the sands before you know it."</p>

<p>With this he slammed down the lid of the chest, and the noise made them
all wink. While they were winking the workman disappeared, tools and
all.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i137.png"

alt="The Deadly Desert Crossed" /></p>

<p>"OH, that's too bad!" cried Dorothy; "I wanted to thank Johnny Dooit for
all his kindness to us."</p>

<p>"He hasn't time to listen to thanks," replied the shaggy man; "but I'm
sure he knows we are grateful. I suppose he is already at work in some
other part of the world."</p>

<p>They now looked more carefully at the sand-boat, and saw that the bottom
was modelled with two sharp runners which would glide through the sand.
The front of the sand-boat was pointed like the bow of a ship, and there
was a rudder at the stern to steer by.</p>

<p>It had been built just at the edge of the desert, so that all its
length lay upon the grey sand except the after part, which still rested
on the strip of grass.</p>

<p>"Get in, my dears," said the shaggy man; "I'm sure I can manage this
boat as well as any sailor. All you need do is sit still in your
places."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i138.png"
width="550px"
height="373px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Dorothy got in, Toto in her arms, and sat on the bottom of the boat just
in front of the mast. Button-Bright sat in front of Dorothy, while Polly
leaned over the bow. The shaggy man knelt behind the mast. When all were
ready he raised the sail half way. The wind caught it. At once the
sand-boat started forward&mdash;slowly at first, then with added speed. The
shaggy man pulled the sail way up, and they flew so fast over the
Deadly Desert that every one held fast to the sides of the boat and
scarcely dared to breathe.</p>

<p>The sand lay in billows, and was in places very uneven, so that the boat
rocked dangerously from side to side; but it never quite tipped over,
and the speed was so great that the shaggy man himself became frightened
and began to wonder how he could make the ship go slower.</p>

<p>"If we're spilled in this sand, in the middle of the desert," Dorothy
thought to herself, "we'll be nothing but dust in a few minutes, and
that will be the end of us."</p>

<p>But they were not spilled, and by-and-bye Polychrome, who was clinging
to the bow and looking straight ahead, saw a dark line before them and
wondered what it was. It grew plainer every second, until she discovered
it to be a row of jagged rocks at the end of the desert, while high
above these rocks she could see a tableland of green grass and beautiful
trees.</p>

<p>"Look out!" she screamed to the shaggy man. "Go slowly, or we shall
smash into the rocks."</p>

<p>He heard her, and tried to pull down the sail; but the wind would not
let go of the broad canvas and the ropes had become tangled.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they drew to the great rocks, and the shaggy man was
in despair because he could do nothing to stop the wild rush of the
sand-boat.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i140.png"

alt="&quot;LOOK OUT!&quot; SCREAMED POLYCHROME" /><br />"LOOK OUT!" SCREAMED POLYCHROME</p>

<p>They reached the edge of the desert and bumped squarely into the rocks.
There was a crash as Dorothy, Button-Bright, Toto and Polly flew up in
the air in a curve like a skyrocket's, one after another landing high
upon the grass, where they rolled and tumbled for a time before they
could stop themselves.</p>

<p>The shaggy man flew after them, head first, and lighted in a heap beside
Toto, who, being much excited at the time, seized one of the donkey ears
between his teeth and shook and worried it as hard as he could, growling
angrily. The shaggy man made the little dog let go, and sat up to look
around him.</p>

<p>Dorothy was feeling one of her front teeth, which was loosened by
knocking against her knee as she fell. Polly was looking sorrowfully at
a rent in her pretty gauze gown, and Button-Bright's fox head had stuck
fast in a gopher hole and he was wiggling his little fat legs
frantically in an effort to get free.</p>

<p>Otherwise they were unhurt by the adventure; so the shaggy man stood up
and pulled Button-Bright out of the hole and went to the edge of the
desert to look at the sand-boat. It was a mere mass of splinters now,
crushed out of shape against the rocks. The wind had torn away the sail
and carried it to the top of a tall tree, where the fragments of it
fluttered like a white flag.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, cheerfully, "we're here; but where the here is I don't
know."</p>

<p>"It must be some part of the Land of Oz," observed Dorothy, coming to
his side.</p>

<p>"Must it?"</p>

<p>"'Course it must. We're across the desert, aren't we? And somewhere in
the middle of Oz is the Emerald City."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the shaggy man, nodding. "Let's go there."</p>

<p>"But I don't see any people about, to show us the way," she continued.</p>

<p>"Let's hunt for them," he suggested. "There must be people somewhere;
but perhaps they did not expect us, and so are not at hand to give us a
welcome."</p>

<p>THEY now made a more careful examination of the country around them. All
was fresh and beautiful after the sultriness of the desert, and the
sunshine and sweet, crisp air were delightful to the wanderers. Little
mounds of yellowish green were away at the right, while on the left
waved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked
like tassels and pompoms. Among the grasses carpeting the ground were
pretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds. After looking at these a
moment Dorothy said reflectively:</p>

<p>"We must be in the Country of the Winkies, for the color of that country
is yellow, and you will notice that 'most everything here is yellow that
has any color at all."</p>

<p>"But I thought this was the Land of Oz," replied the shaggy man, as if
greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>"So it is," she declared; "but there are four parts to the Land of Oz.
The North Country is purple, and it's the Country of the Gillikins. The
East country is blue, and that's the Country of the Munchkins. Down at
the South is the red Country of the Quadlings, and here, in the West,
the yellow Country of the Winkies. This is the part that is ruled by the
Tin Woodman, you know."</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Why, he's the tin man I told you about. His name is Nick Chopper, and
he has a lovely heart given him by the wonderful Wizard."</p>

<p>"Where does <i>he</i> live?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The Wizard? Oh, he lives in the Emerald City, which is just in the
middle of Oz, where the corners of the four countries meet."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Button-Bright, puzzled by this explanation.</p>

<p>"We must be some distance from the Emerald City," remarked the shaggy
man.</p>

<p>"That's true," she replied; "so we'd better start on and see if we can
find any of the Winkies. They're nice people," she continued, as the
little party began walking toward the group of trees, "and I came here
once with my friends the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, and the
Cowardly Lion, to fight a wicked witch who had made all the Winkies her
slaves."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i145.png"
width="550px"
height="354px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Did you conquer her?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Why, I melted her with a bucket of water, and that was the end of her,"
replied Dorothy. "After that the people were free, you know, and they
made Nick Chopper&mdash;that's the Tin Woodman&mdash;their Emp'ror."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Emp'ror? Oh, it's something like an alderman, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the boy.</p>

<p>"But I thought Princess Ozma ruled Oz," said the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"So she does; she rules the Emerald City and all the four countries of
Oz; but each country has another little ruler, not so big as Ozma. It's
like the officers of an army, you see; the little rulers are all
captains, and Ozma's the general."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the trees, which stood in a perfect circle
and just far enough apart so that their thick branches touched&mdash;or
"shook hands," as Button-Bright remarked. Under the shade of the trees
they found, in the center of the circle, a crystal pool, its water as
still as glass. It must have been deep, too, for when Polychrome bent
over it she gave a little sigh of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a mirror!" she cried; for she could see all her pretty face
and fluffy, rainbow-tinted gown reflected in the pool, as natural as
life.</p>

<p>Dorothy bent over, too, and began to arrange her hair, blown by the
desert wind into straggling tangles. Button-Bright leaned over the edge
next, and then began to cry, for the sight of his fox head frightened
the poor little fellow.</p>

<p>"I guess I won't look," remarked the shaggy man, sadly, for he didn't
like his donkey head, either. While Polly and Dorothy tried to comfort
Button-Bright, the shaggy man sat down near the edge of the pool, where
his image could not be reflected, and stared at the water thoughtfully.
As he did this he noticed a silver plate fastened to a rock just under
the surface of the water, and on the silver plate was engraved these
words:</p>

<div class="box4">
<p class="truth">THE TRUTH POND</p>
</div>

<p>"Ah!" cried the shaggy man, springing to his feet with eager joy; "we've
found it at last."</p>

<p>"Found what?" asked Dorothy, running to him.</p>

<p>"The Truth Pond. Now, at last, I may get rid of this frightful head; for
we were told, you remember, that only the Truth Pond could restore to me
my proper face."</p>

<p>"Me, too!" shouted Button-Bright, trotting up to them.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Dorothy. "It will cure you both of your bad heads, I
guess. Isn't it lucky we found it?"</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i147.png"
width="550px"
height="353px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"It is, indeed," replied the shaggy man. "I hated dreadfully to go to
Princess Ozma looking like this; and she's to have a birthday
celebration, too."</p>

<p>Just then a splash startled them, for Button-Bright, in his anxiety to
see the pool that would "cure" him, had stepped too near the edge and
tumbled heels over head into the water. Down he went, out of sight
entirely, so that only his sailor hat floated on the top of the Truth
Pond.</p>

<p>He soon bobbed up, and the shaggy man seized him by his sailor collar
and dragged him to the shore, dripping and gasping for breath. They all
looked upon the boy wonderingly, for the fox head with its sharp nose
and pointed ears was gone, and in its place appeared the chubby round
face and blue eyes and pretty curls that had belonged to Button-Bright
before King Dox of Foxville transformed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a darling!" cried Polly, and would have hugged the little one
had he not been so wet.</p>

<p>Their joyful exclamations made the child rub the water out of his eyes
and look at his friends questioningly.</p>

<p>"You're all right now, dear," said Dorothy. "Come and look at yourself."
She led him to the pool, and although there were still a few ripples on
the surface of the water he could see his reflection plainly.</p>

<p>"It's me!" he said, in a pleased yet awed whisper.</p>

<p>"'Course it is," replied the girl; "and we're all as glad as you are,
Button-Bright."</p>

<p>"Well," announced the shaggy man, "it's my turn next." He took off his
shaggy coat and laid it on the grass and dived head first into the Truth
Pond.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i150.png"
width="550px"
height="362px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>When he came up the donkey head had disappeared, and the shaggy man's
own shaggy head was in its place, with the water dripping in little
streams from his shaggy whiskers. He scrambled ashore and shook himself
to get off some of the wet, and then leaned over the pool to look
admiringly at his reflected face.</p>

<p>"I may not be strictly beautiful, even now," he said to his companions,
who watched him with smiling faces; "but I'm so much handsomer than any
donkey that I feel as proud as I can be."</p>

<p>"You're all right, Shaggy Man," declared Dorothy. "And Button-Bright is
all right, too. So let's thank the Truth Pond for being so nice, and
start on our journey to the Emerald City."</p>

<p>"I hate to leave it," murmured the shaggy man, with a sigh. "A truth
pond wouldn't be a bad thing to carry around with us." But he put on his
coat and started with the others in search of some one to direct them on
their way.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i152.png"

<p>THEY had not walked far across the flower-strewn meadows when they came
upon a fine road leading toward the northwest and winding gracefully
among the pretty yellow hills.</p>

<p>"That way," said Dorothy, "must be the direction of the Emerald City.
We'd better follow the road until we meet some one or come to a house."</p>

<p>The sun soon dried Button-Bright's sailor suit and the shaggy man's
shaggy clothes, and so pleased were they at regaining their own heads
that they did not mind at all the brief discomfort of getting wet.</p>

<p>"It's good to be able to whistle again," remarked the shaggy man, "for
those donkey lips were so thick I could not whistle a note with them."
He warbled a tune as merrily as any bird.</p>

<p>"You'll look more natural at the birthday celebration, too," said
Dorothy, happy in seeing her friends so happy.</p>

<p>Polychrome was dancing ahead in her usual sprightly manner, whirling
gaily along the smooth, level road, until she passed from sight around
the curve of one of the mounds. Suddenly they heard her exclaim "Oh!"
and she appeared again, running toward them at full speed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Polly?" asked Dorothy, perplexed.</p>

<p>There was no need for the Rainbow's Daughter to answer, for turning the
bend in the road there came advancing slowly toward them a funny round
man made of burnished copper, gleaming brightly in the sun. Perched on
the copper man's shoulder sat a yellow hen, with fluffy feathers and a
pearl necklace around her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tik-tok!" cried Dorothy, running forward. When she came to him the
copper man lifted the little girl in his copper arms and kissed her
cheek with his copper lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Billina!" cried Dorothy, in a glad voice, and the yellow hen flew
to her arms, to be hugged and petted by turns.</p>

<p>The others were curiously crowding around the group, and the girl said
to them:</p>

<p>"It's Tik-tok and Billina; and oh! I'm so glad to see them again."</p>

<p>"Wel-come to Oz," said the copper man, in a monotonous voice.</p>

<p>Dorothy sat right down in the road, the yellow hen in her arms, and
began to stroke Billina's back. Said the hen:</p>

<p>"Dorothy, dear, I've some wonderful news to tell you."</p>

<p>"Tell it quick, Billina!" said the girl.</p>

<p>Just then Toto, who had been growling to himself in a cross way gave a
sharp bark and flew at the yellow hen, who ruffled her feathers and let
out such an angry screech that Dorothy was startled.</p>

<p>"Stop, Toto! Stop that this minute!" she commanded. "Can't you see that
Billina is my friend?" In spite of this warning had she not grabbed
Toto quickly by the neck the little dog would have done the yellow hen a
mischief, and even now he struggled madly to escape Dorothy's grasp. She
slapped his cars once or twice and told him to behave, and the yellow
hen flew to Tik-tok's shoulder again, where she was safe.</p>

<p>"What a brute!" croaked Billina, glaring down at the little dog.</p>

<p>"Toto isn't a brute," replied Dorothy; "but at home Uncle Henry has to
whip him sometimes for chasing the chickens. Now, look here, Toto," she
added, holding up her finger and speaking sternly to him, "you've got to
understand that Billina is one of my dearest friends, and mustn't be
hurt&mdash;now or ever."</p>

<p>Toto wagged his tail as if he understood.</p>

<p>"The miserable thing can't talk," said Billina, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes, he can," replied Dorothy; "he talks with his tail, and I know
everything he says. If you could wag your tail, Billina, you wouldn't
need words to talk with."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Billina.</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense at all. Just now Toto says he's sorry, and that he'll
try to love you for my sake. Don't you, Toto?"</p>

<p>"Bow-wow!" said Toto, wagging his tail again.</p>

<p>"But I've such wonderful news for you; Dorothy," cried the yellow hen;
"I've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, dear," interrupted the little girl; "I've got to
introduce you all, first. That's manners, Billina. This," turning to her
traveling companions, "is Mr. Tik-tok, who works by machinery, 'cause
his thoughts wind up, and his talk winds up, and his action winds
up&mdash;like a clock."</p>

<p>"Do they all wind up together?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"No; each one separate. But he works just lovely, and Tik-tok was a good
friend to me once, and saved my life&mdash;and Billina's life, too."</p>

<p>"Is he alive?" asked Button-Bright, looking hard at the copper man.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, but his machinery makes him just as good as alive." She turned
to the copper man and said politely: "Mr. Tik-tok, these are my new
friends: the shaggy man, and Polly the Rainbow's Daughter, and
Button-Bright, and Toto. Only Toto isn't a new friend, 'cause he's been
to Oz before."</p>

<p>The copper man bowed low, removing his copper hat as he did so.</p>

<p>"I'm ve-ry pleased to meet Dor-o-thy's fr-r-r-r-r&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he stopped short.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess his speech needs winding!" said the little girl, running
behind the copper man to get the key off a hook at his back. She wound
him up at a place under his right arm and he went on to say:</p>

<p>"Par-don me for run-ning down. I was a-bout to say I am pleased to meet
Dor-o-thy's friends, who must be my friends." The words were somewhat
jerky, but plain to understand.</p>

<p>"And this is Billina," continued Dorothy, introducing the yellow hen,
and they all bowed to her in turn.</p>

<p>"I've such wonderful news," said the hen, turning her head so that one
bright eye looked full at Dorothy.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I've hatched out ten of the loveliest chicks you ever saw."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice! And where are they, Billina?"</p>

<p>"I left them at home. But they're beauties, I assure you, and all
wonderfully clever. I've named them Dorothy."</p>

<p>"Which one?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"All of them," replied Billina.</p>

<p>"That's funny. Why did you name them all with the same name?"</p>

<p>"It was so hard to tell them apart," explained the hen. "Now, when I
call 'Dorothy,' they all come running to me in a bunch; it's much
easier, after all, than having a separate name for each."</p>

<p>"I'm just dying to see 'em, Billina," said Dorothy, eagerly. "But tell
me, my friends, how did you happen to be here, in the Country of the
Winkies, the first of all to meet us?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," answered Tik-tok, in his monotonous voice, all the
sounds of his words being on one level&mdash;"Prin-cess Oz-ma saw you in her
mag-ic pic-ture, and knew you were com-ing here; so she sent Bil-lin-a
and me to wel-come you, as she could not come her-self; so
that&mdash;fiz-i-dig-le cum-so-lut-ing hy-ber-gobble in-tu-zib-ick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Whatever's the matter now?" cried Dorothy, as the copper
man continued to babble these unmeaning words, which no one could
understand at all because they had no sense.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright, who was half scared. Polly whirled
away to a distance and turned to look at the copper man in a fright.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i159.png"
width="550px"
height="322px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"His thoughts have run down, this time," remarked Billina composedly, as
she sat on Tik-tok's shoulder and pruned her sleek feathers. "When he
can't think he can't talk properly, any more than you can. You'll have
to wind up his thoughts, Dorothy, or else I'll have to finish his story
myself."</p>

<p>Dorothy ran around and got the key again and wound up Tik-tok under his
left arm, after which he could speak plainly again.</p>

<p>"Par-don me," he said, "but when my thoughts run down my speech has no
mean-ing, for words are formed on-ly by thought. I was a-bout to say
that Oz-ma sent us to wel-come you and in-vite you to come straight to
the Em-er-ald Ci-ty. She was too bus-y to come her-self, for she is
pre-par-ing for her birth-day cel-e-bra-tion, which is to be a grand
af-fair."</p>

<p>"I've heard of it," said Dorothy, "and I'm glad we've come in time to
attend. Is it far from here to the Emerald City?"</p>

<p>"Not ve-ry far," answered Tik-tok, "and we have plen-ty of time.
To-night we will stop at the pal-ace of the Tin Wood-man, and to-mor-row
night we will ar-rive at the Em-er-ald Ci-ty."</p>

<p>"Goody!" cried Dorothy. "I'd like to see dear Nick Chopper again. How's
his heart?"</p>

<p>"It's fine," said Billina; "the Tin Woodman says it gets softer and
kindlier every day. He's waiting at his castle to welcome you, Dorothy;
but he couldn't come with us because he 'is getting polished as bright
as possible for Ozma's party."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Dorothy, "let's start on, and we can talk more as we
go."</p>

<p>They proceeded on their journey in a friendly group, for Polychrome had
discovered that the copper man was harmless and was no longer afraid of
him. Button-Bright was also reassured, and took quite a fancy to
Tik-tok. He wanted the clockwork man to open himself, so that he might
see the wheels go round; but that was a thing Tik-tok could not do.
Button-Bright then wanted to wind up the copper man, and Dorothy
promised he should do so as soon as any part of the machinery ran down.
This pleased Button-Bright, who held fast to one of Tik-tok's copper
hands as he trudged along the road, while Dorothy walked on the other
side of her old friend and Billina perched by turns upon his shoulder or
his copper hat. Polly once more joyously danced ahead and Toto ran after
her, barking with glee. The shaggy man was left to walk behind; but he
didn't seem to mind that a bit, and whistled merrily or looked curiously
upon the pretty scenes they passed.</p>

<p>At last they came to a hilltop from which the tin castle of Nick Chopper
could plainly be seen, its towers glistening magnificently under the
rays of the declining sun.</p>

<p>"How pretty!" exclaimed Dorothy. "I've never seen the Emp'ror's new
house before."</p>

<p>"He built it because the old castle was damp, and likely to rust his tin
body," said Billina. "All those towers and steeples and domes and gables
took a lot of tin, as you can see."</p>

<p>"Is it a toy?" asked Button-Bright, softly.</p>

<p>"No, dear," answered Dorothy; "it's better than that. It's the fairy
dwelling of a fairy prince."</p>

alt="The Emperor's Tin Castle" /></p>


<p>THE grounds around Nick Chopper's new house were laid out in pretty
flower-beds, with fountains of crystal water and statues of tin
representing the Emperor's personal friends. Dorothy was astonished and
delighted to find a tin statue of herself standing on a tin pedestal at
a bend in the avenue leading up to the entrance. It was life-size and
showed her in her sunbonnet with her basket on her arm, just as she had
first appeared in the Land of Oz.</p>

<p>"Oh, Toto&mdash;you're there too!" she exclaimed; and sure enough there was
the tin figure of Toto lying at the tin Dorothy's feet.</p>

<p>Also Dorothy saw figures of the Scarecrow, and the Wizard, and Ozma, and
of many others, including Tik-tok. They reached the grand tin entrance
to the tin castle, and the Tin Woodman himself came running out of the
door to embrace little Dorothy and give her a glad welcome. He welcomed
her friends as well, and the Rainbow's Daughter he declared to be the
loveliest vision his tin eyes had ever beheld. He patted Button-Bright's
curly head tenderly, for he was fond of children, and turned to the
shaggy man and shook both his hands at the same time.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i163.png"

<p>Nick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies, who was also known throughout
the Land of Oz as the Tin Woodman, was certainly a remarkable person. He
was neatly made, all of tin, nicely soldered at the joints, and his
various limbs were cleverly hinged to his body so that he could use them
nearly as well as if they had been common flesh. Once, he told the
shaggy man, he had been made all of flesh and bones, as others people
are, and then he chopped wood in the forests to earn his living. But the
axe slipped so often and cut off parts of him&mdash;which he had replaced
with tin&mdash;that finally there was no flesh left, nothing but tin; so he
became a real tin woodman. The wonderful Wizard of Oz had given him an
excellent heart to replace his old one, and he didn't at all mind being
tin. Every one loved him, he loved every one; and he was therefore as
happy as the day was long.</p>

<p>The Emperor was proud of his new tin castle, and showed his visitors
through all the rooms. Every bit of the furniture was made of brightly
polished tin&mdash;the tables, chairs, beds, and all&mdash;even the floors and
walls were of tin.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said he, "that there are no cleverer tinsmiths in all the
world than the Winkies. It would be hard to match this castle in Kansas;
wouldn't it, little Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"Very hard," replied the child, gravely.</p>

<p>"It must have cost a lot of money," remarked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"Money! Money in Oz!" cried the Tin Woodman. "What a queer idea! Did you
suppose we are so vulgar as to use money here?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"If we used money to buy things with, instead of love and kindness and
the desire to please one another, then we should be no better than the
rest of the world," declared the Tin Woodman. "Fortunately money is not
known in the Land of Oz at all. We have no rich, and no poor; for what
one wishes the others all try to give him, in order to make him happy,
and no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the shaggy man, greatly pleased to hear this. "I also
despise money&mdash;a man in Butterfield owes me fifteen cents, and I will
not take it from him. The Land of Oz is surely the most favored land in
all the world, and its people the happiest. I should like to live here
always."</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman listened with respectful attention. Already he loved the
shaggy man, although he did not yet know of the Love Magnet. So he said:</p>

<p>"If you can prove to the Princess Ozma that you are honest and true and
worthy of our friendship, you may indeed live here all your days, and be
as happy as we are."</p>

<p>"I'll try to prove that," said the shaggy man, earnestly.</p>

<p>"And now," continued the Emperor, "you must all go to your rooms and
prepare for dinner, which will presently be served in the grand tin
dining-hall. I am sorry, Shaggy Man, that I can not offer you a change
of clothing; but I dress only in tin, myself, and I suppose that would
not suit you."</p>

<p>"I care little about dress," said the shaggy man, indifferently.</p>

<p>"So I should imagine," replied the Emperor, with true politeness.</p>

<p>They were shown to their rooms and permitted to make such toilets as
they could, and soon they assembled again in the grand tin dining-hall,
even Toto being present. For the Emperor was fond of Dorothy's little
dog, and the girl explained to her friends that in Oz all animals were
treated with as much consideration as the people&mdash;"if they behave
themselves," she added.</p>

<p>Toto behaved himself, and sat in a tin high-chair beside Dorothy and ate
his dinner from a tin platter.</p>

<p>Indeed, they all ate from tin dishes, but these were of pretty shapes
and brightly polished; Dorothy thought they were just as good as silver.</p>

<p>Button-Bright looked curiously at the man who had "no appetite inside
him," for the Tin Woodman, although he had prepared so fine a feast for
his guests, ate not a mouthful himself, sitting patiently in his place
to see that all built so they could eat were well and plentifully
served.</p>

alt="POLYCHROME DANCED GRACEFULLY TO THE MUSIC" /><br />POLYCHROME DANCED GRACEFULLY TO THE MUSIC</p>

<p>What pleased Button-Bright most about the dinner was the tin orchestra
that played sweet music while the company ate. The players were not
tin, being just ordinary Winkies; but the instruments they played upon
were all tin&mdash;tin trumpets, tin fiddles, tin drums and cymbals and
flutes and horns and all. They played so nicely the "Shining Emperor
Waltz," composed expressly in honor of the Tin Woodman by Mr. H. M.
Wogglebug, T. E., that Polly could not resist dancing to it. After she
had tasted a few dewdrops, freshly gathered for her, she danced
gracefully to the music while the others finished their repast; and when
she whirled until her fleecy draperies of rainbow hues enveloped her
like a cloud, the Tin Woodman was so delighted that he clapped his tin
hands until the noise of them drowned the sound of the cymbals.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a merry meal, although Polychrome ate little and the
host nothing at all.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry the Rainbow's Daughter missed her mist-cakes," said the Tin
Woodman to Dorothy; "but by a mistake Miss Polly's mist-cakes were
mislaid and not missed until now. I'll try to have some for her
breakfast."</p>

<p>They spent the evening telling stories, and the next morning left the
splendid tin castle and set out upon the road to the Emerald City. The
Tin Woodman went with them, of course, having by this time been so
brightly polished that he sparkled like silver. His axe, which he always
carried with him, had a steel blade that was tin plated and a handle
covered with tin plate beautifully engraved and set with diamonds.</p>

<p>The Winkies assembled before the castle gates and cheered their Emperor
as he marched away, and it was easy to see that they all loved him
dearly.</p>

alt="Visiting the Pumpkin-Field" /></p>


<p>Dorothy let Button-Bright wind up the clock-work in the copper man this
morning&mdash;his thinking machine first, then his speech, and finally his
action; so he would doubtless run perfectly until they had reached the
Emerald City. The copper man and the tin man were good friends, and not
so much alike as you might think. For one was alive and the other moved
by means of machinery; one was tall and angular and the other short and
round. You could love the Tin Woodman because he had a fine nature,
kindly and simple; but the machine man you could only admire without
loving, since to love such a thing as he was as impossible as to love a
sewing-machine or an automobile. Yet Tik-tok was popular with the people
of Oz because he was so trustworthy, reliable and true; he was sure to
do exactly what he was wound up to do, at all times and in all
circumstances. Perhaps it is better to be a machine that does its duty
than a flesh-and-blood person who will not, for a dead truth is better
than a live falsehood.</p>

<p>About noon the travelers reached a large field of pumpkins&mdash;a vegetable
quite appropriate to the yellow country of the Winkies&mdash;and some of the
pumpkins which grew there were of remarkable size. Just before they
entered upon this field they saw three little mounds that looked like
graves, with a pretty headstone to each one of them.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i171.png"
width="550px"
height="314px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Dorothy, in wonder.</p>

<p>"It's Jack Pumpkinhead's private graveyard," replied the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"But I thought nobody ever died in Oz," she said.</p>

<p>"Nor do they; although if one is bad, he may be condemned and killed by
the good citizens," he answered.</p>

<p>Dorothy ran over to the little graves and read the words engraved upon
the tombstones. The first one said:</p>

<div class="box5"><p class="c">
<span class="ctt">Here Lies the Mortal Part of</span><br />
<span class="jack">JACK PUMPKINHEAD</span><br /><span class="ctt">Which Spoiled April 9th.</span></p></div>

<p>She then went to the next stone, which read:</p>

<div class="box5"><p class="c">
<span class="ctt">Here Lies the Mortal Part of</span><br />
<span class="jack">JACK PUMPKINHEAD</span><br /><span class="ctt">Which Spoiled October 2nd.</span></p></div>

<p>On the third stone were carved these words:</p>

<div class="box5"><p class="c">
<span class="ctt">Here Lies the Mortal Part of</span><br />
<span class="jack">JACK PUMPKINHEAD</span><br /><span class="ctt">Which Spoiled January 24th.</span></p></div>

<p>"Poor Jack!" sighed Dorothy. "I'm sorry he had to die in three parts,
for I hoped to see him again."</p>

<p>"So you shall," declared the Tin Woodman, "since he is still alive. Come
with me to his house, for Jack is now a farmer and lives in this very
pumpkin field."</p>

<p>They walked over to a monstrous big, hollow pumpkin which had a door and
windows cut through the rind. There was a stovepipe running through the
stem, and six steps had been built leading up to the front door.</p>

<p>They walked up to this door and looked in. Seated on a bench was a man
clothed in a spotted shirt, a red vest, and faded blue trousers, whose
body was merely sticks of wood, jointed clumsily together. On his neck
was set a round, yellow pumpkin, with a face carved on it such as a boy
often carves on a jack-lantern.</p>

<p>This queer man was engaged in snapping slippery pumpkin-seeds with his
wooden fingers, trying to hit a target on the other side of the room
with them. He did not know he had visitors until Dorothy exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, it's Jack Pumpkinhead himself!"</p>

<p>He turned and saw them, and at once came forward to greet the little
Kansas girl and Nick Chopper, and to be introduced to their new friends.</p>

<p>Button-Bright was at first rather shy with the quaint Pumpkinhead, but
Jack's face was so jolly and smiling&mdash;being carved that way&mdash;that the
boy soon grew to like him.</p>

<p>"I thought, a while ago, that you were buried in three parts," said
Dorothy; "but now I see you're just the same as ever."</p>

<p>"Not quite the same, my dear, for my mouth is a little more one-sided
than it used to be; but pretty nearly the same. I've a new head, and
this is the fourth one I've owned since Ozma first made me and brought
me to life by sprinkling me with the Magic Powder."</p>

<p>"What became of the other heads, Jack?"</p>

<p>"They spoiled and I buried them, for they were not even fit for pies.
Each time Ozma has carved me a new head just like the old one, and as my
body is by far the largest part of me I am still Jack Pumpkinhead, no
matter how often I change my upper end. Once we had a dreadful time to
find another pumpkin, as they were out of season, and so I was obliged
to wear my old head a little longer than was strictly healthy. But after
this sad experience I resolved to raise pumpkins myself, so as never to
be caught again without one handy; and now I have this fine field that
you see before you. Some grow pretty big&mdash;too big to be used for
heads&mdash;so I dug out this one and use it for a house."</p>

<p>"Isn't it damp?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Not very. There isn't much left but the shell, you see, and it will
last a long time yet."</p>

<p>"I think you are brighter than you used to be, Jack," said the Tin
Woodman. "Your last head was a stupid one."</p>

<p>"The seeds in this one are better," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Ozma's party?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he; "I wouldn't miss it for anything. Ozma's my parent, you
know, because she built my body and carved my pumpkin head. I'll follow
you to the Emerald City to-morrow, where we shall meet again. I can't go
to-day, because I have to plant fresh pumpkin-seeds and water the young
vines. But give my love to Ozma, and tell her I'll be there in time for
the jubilation."</p>

<p>"We will," she promised; and then they all left him and resumed their
journey.</p>

<p>THE neat yellow houses of the Winkies were now to be seen standing here
and there along the roadway, giving the country a more cheerful and
civilized look. They were farm-houses, though, and set far apart; for in
the Land of Oz there were no towns or villages except the magnificent
Emerald City in its center.</p>

<p>Hedges of evergreen or of yellow roses bordered the broad highway and
the farms showed the care of their industrious inhabitants. The nearer
the travelers came to the great city the more prosperous the country
became, and they crossed many bridges over the sparkling streams and
rivulets that watered the lands.</p>

<p>As they walked leisurely along the shaggy man said to the Tin Woodman:</p>

<p>"What sort of a Magic Powder was it, that made your friend the
Pumpkinhead live?"</p>

<p>"It was called the Powder of Life," was the answer; "and it was invented
by a crooked Sorcerer who lived in the mountains of the North Country. A
Witch named Mombi got some of this powder from the crooked Sorcerer and
took it home with her. Ozma lived with the Witch then, for it was before
she became our Princess, while Mombi had transformed her into the shape
of a boy. Well, while Mombi was gone to the crooked Sorcerer's, the boy
made this pumpkin-headed man to amuse himself, and also with the hope of
frightening the Witch with it when she returned. But Mombi was not
scared, and she sprinkled the Pumpkinhead with her Magic Powder of Life,
to see if the Powder would work. Ozma was watching, and saw the
Pumpkinhead come to life; so that night she took the pepper-box
containing the Powder and ran away with it and with Jack, in search of
adventures."</p>

<p>"Next day they found a wooden Saw-Horse standing by the roadside, and
sprinkled it with the Powder. It came to life at once, and Jack
Pumpkinhead rode the Saw-Horse to the Emerald City."</p>

<p>"What became of the Saw-Horse, afterward?" asked the shaggy man, much
interested in this story.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i178.png"
width="550px"
height="358px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Oh, it's alive yet, and you will probably meet it presently in the
Emerald City. Afterward Ozma used the last of the Powder to bring the
Flying Gump to life; but as soon as it had carried her away from her
enemies the Gump was taken apart, so it doesn't exist any more."</p>

<p>"It's too bad the Powder of Life was all used up," remarked the shaggy
man; "it would be a handy thing to have around."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that, sir," answered the Tin Woodman. "A while ago
the crooked Sorcerer who invented the magic Powder fell down a precipice
and was killed. All his possessions went to a relative&mdash;an old woman
named Dyna, who lives in the Emerald City. She went to the mountains
where the Sorcerer had lived and brought away everything she thought of
value. Among them was a small bottle of the Powder of Life; but of
course Dyna didn't know it was a magic Powder, at all. It happened she
had once had a big blue bear for a pet; but the bear choked to death on
a fishbone one day, and she loved it so dearly that Dyna made a rug of
its skin, leaving the head and four paws on the hide. She kept the rug
on the floor of her front parlor."</p>

<p>"I've seen rugs like that," said the shaggy man, nodding, "but never one
made from a blue bear."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the Tin Woodman, "the old woman had an idea that the
Powder in the bottle must be moth-powder, because it smelled something
like moth-powder; so one day she sprinkled it on her bear rug to keep
the moths out of it. She said, looking lovingly at the skin: 'I wish my
dear bear were alive again!' To her horror the bear rug at once came to
life, having been sprinkled with the Magic Powder; and now this live
bear rug is a great trial to her, and makes her a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"Well, it stands up on its four feet and walks all around, and gets in
the way; and that spoils it for a rug. It can't speak, although it is
alive; for, while its head might say words, it has no breath in a solid
body to push the words out of its mouth. It's a very slimpsy affair
altogether, that bear rug, and the old woman is sorry it came to life.
Every day she has to scold it, and make it lie down flat on the parlor
floor to be walked upon; but sometimes when she goes to market the rug
will hump up its back skin, and stand on its four feet, and trot along
after her."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i180.png"

<p>"I should think Dyna would like that," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Well, she doesn't; because every one knows it isn't a real bear, but
just a hollow skin, and so of no actual use in the world except for a
rug," answered the Tin Woodman. "Therefore I believe it is a good thing
that all the magic Powder of Life is now used up, as it cannot cause
any more trouble."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>At noon they stopped at a farm-house, where it delighted the farmer and
his wife to be able to give them a good luncheon. The farm people knew
Dorothy, having seen her when she was in the country before, and they
treated the little girl with as much respect as they did the Emperor,
because she was a friend of the powerful Princess Ozma.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far after leaving this farm-house before coming
to a high bridge over a broad river. This river, the Tin Woodman
informed them, was the boundary between the Country of the Winkies and
the territory of the Emerald City. The city itself was still a long way
off, but all around it was a green meadow, as pretty as a well-kept
lawn, and in this were neither houses nor farms to spoil the beauty of
the scene.</p>

<p>From the top of the high bridge they could see far away the magnificent
spires and splendid domes of the superb city, sparkling like brilliant
jewels as they towered above the emerald walls. The shaggy man drew a
deep breath of awe and amazement, for never had he dreamed that such a
grand and beautiful place could exist&mdash;even in the fairyland of Oz.</p>

<p>Polly was so pleased that her violet eyes sparkled like amethysts, and
she danced away from her companions across the bridge and into a group
of feathery trees lining both the roadsides. These trees she stopped to
look at with pleasure and surprise, for their leaves were shaped like
ostrich plumes, their feather edges beautifully curled; and all the
plumes were tinted in the same dainty rainbow hues that appeared in
Polychrome's own pretty gauze gown.</p>

<p>"Father ought to see these trees," she murmured; "they are almost as
lovely as his own rainbows."</p>

<p>Then she gave a start of terror, for beneath the trees came stalking two
great beasts, either one big enough to crush the little Daughter of the
Rainbow with one blow of his paws, or to eat her up with one snap of his
enormous jaws. One was a tawny lion, as tall as a horse, nearly; the
other a striped tiger almost the same size.</p>

<p>Polly was too frightened to scream or to stir; she stood still with a
wildly beating heart until Dorothy rushed past her and with a glad cry
threw her arms around the huge lion's neck, hugging and kissing the
beast with evident joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad to see you again!" cried the little Kansas girl. "And
the Hungry Tiger, too! How fine you're both looking. Are you well and
happy?"</p>

<p>"We certainly are, Dorothy," answered the Lion, in a deep voice that
sounded pleasant and kind; "and we are greatly pleased that you have
come to Ozma's party. It's going to be a grand affair, I promise you."</p>

<p>"There will be lots of fat babies at the celebration, I hear," remarked
the Hungry Tiger, yawning so that his mouth opened dreadfully wide and
showed all his big, sharp teeth; "but of course I can't eat any of 'em."</p>

<p>"Is your Conscience still in good order?" asked Dorothy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; it rules me like a tyrant," answered the Tiger, sorrowfully. "I
can imagine nothing more unpleasant than to own a Conscience," and he
winked slyly at his friend the Lion.</p>

<p>"You're fooling me!" said Dorothy, with a laugh. "I don't b'lieve you'd
eat a baby if you lost your Conscience. Come here, Polly," she called,
"and be introduced to my friends."</p>

<p>Polly advanced rather shyly.</p>

<p>"You have some queer friends, Dorothy," she said.</p>

<p>"The queerness doesn't matter, so long as they're friends," was the
answer. "This is the Cowardly Lion, who isn't a coward at all, but just
thinks he is. The Wizard gave him some courage once, and he has part of
it left."</p>

<p>The Lion bowed with great dignity to Polly.</p>

<p>"You are very lovely, my dear," said he. "I hope we shall be friends
when we are better acquainted."</p>

<p>"And this is the Hungry Tiger," continued Dorothy. "He says he longs to
eat fat babies; but the truth is he is never hungry at all, 'cause he
gets plenty to eat; and I don't s'pose he'd hurt anybody even if he was
hungry."</p>

<p>"Hush, Dorothy," whispered the Tiger; "you'll ruin my reputation if you
are not more discreet. It isn't what we are, but what folks think we
are, that counts in this world. And come to think of it Miss Polly would
make a fine variegated breakfast, I'm sure."</p>

<p>THE others now came up, and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the
Tiger cordially. Button-Bright yelled with fear when Dorothy first took
his hand and led him toward the great beasts; but the girl insisted they
were kind and good, and so the boy mustered up courage enough to pat
their heads; after they had spoken to him gently and he had looked into
their intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely and he was so
delighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close to them and
stroke their soft fur every minute.</p>

<p>As for the shaggy man, he might have been afraid if he had met the
beasts alone, or in any other country; but so many were the marvels in
the Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised, and Dorothy's
friendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were
safe companions. Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting,
for he knew the beast of old and loved him, and it was funny to see how
gently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Toto's head. The little dog
smelled of the Tiger's nose and the Tiger politely shook paws with him;
so they were quite likely to become firm friends.</p>

<p>Tik-tok and Billina knew the beasts well, so merely bade them good day
and asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma.</p>

<p>Now it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were drawing
behind them a splendid golden chariot, to which they were harnessed by
golden cords. The body of the chariot was decorated on the outside with
designs in clusters of sparkling emeralds, while inside it was lined
with a green and gold satin, and the cushions of the seats were of green
plush embroidered in gold with a crown, underneath which was a monogram.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Ozma's own royal chariot!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Cowardly Lion; "Ozma sent us to meet you here, for she
feared you would be weary with your long walk and she wished you to
enter the City in a style becoming your exalted rank."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Polly, looking at Dorothy curiously. "Do you belong to the
nobility?"</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i188.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Just in Oz I do," said the child, "'cause Ozma made me a Princess, you
know. But when I'm home in Kansas I'm only a country girl, and have to
help with the churning and wipe the dishes while Aunt Em washes 'em. Do
you have to help wash dishes on the rainbow, Polly?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," answered Polychrome, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't have to work any in Oz, either," said Dorothy. "It's kind
of fun to be a Princess once in a while; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Dorothy and Polychrome and Button-Bright are all to ride in the
chariot," said the Lion. "So get in, my dears, and be careful not to mar
the gold or put your dusty feet on the embroidery."</p>

<p>Button-Bright was delighted to ride behind such a superb team, and he
told Dorothy it made him feel like an actor in a circus. As the strides
of the animals brought them nearer to the Emerald City every one bowed
respectfully to the children, as well as to the Tin Woodman, Tik-tok,
and the shaggy man, who were following behind.</p>

<p>The Yellow Hen had perched upon the back of the chariot, where she could
tell Dorothy more about her wonderful chickens as they rode. And so the
grand chariot came finally to the high wall surrounding the City, and
paused before the magnificent jewel-studded gates.</p>

<p>These were opened by a cheerful looking little man who wore green
spectacles over his eyes. Dorothy introduced him to her friends as the
Guardian of the Gates, and they noticed a big bunch of keys suspended on
the golden chain that hung around his neck. The chariot passed through
the outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in the thick wall, and
through the inner gates into the streets of the Emerald City.</p>

<p>Polychrome exclaimed in rapture at the wondrous beauty that met her eyes
on every side as they rode through this stately and imposing City, the
equal of which has never been discovered, even in Fairyland.
Button-Bright could only say "My!" so amazing was the sight; but his
eyes were wide open and he tried to look in every direction at the same
time, so as not to miss anything.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i190.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>The shaggy man was fairly astounded at what he saw, for the graceful and
handsome buildings were covered with plates of gold and set with
emeralds so splendid and valuable that in any other part of the world
any one of them would have been worth a fortune to its owner. The
sidewalks were superb marble slabs polished as smooth as glass, and the
curbs that separated the walks from the broad street were also set thick
with clustered emeralds. There were many people on these walks&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;all dressed in handsome garments of silk or satin
or velvet, with beautiful jewels. Better even than this: all seemed
happy and contented, for their faces were smiling and free from care,
and music and laughter might be heard on every side.</p>

<p>"Don't they work, at all?" asked the shaggy man.</p>

<p>"To be sure they work," replied the Tin Woodman; "this fair city could
not be built or cared for without labor, nor could the fruit and
vegetables and other food be provided for the inhabitants to eat. But no
one works more than half his time, and the people of Oz enjoy their
labors as much as they do their play."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful!" declared the shaggy man. "I do hope Ozma will let me
live here."</p>

<p>The chariot, winding through many charming streets, paused before a
building so vast and noble and elegant that even Button-Bright guessed
at once that it was the Royal Palace. Its gardens and ample grounds were
surrounded by a separate wall, not so high or thick as the wall around
the City, but more daintily designed and built all of green marble. The
gates flew open as the chariot appeared before them, and the Cowardly
Lion and Hungry Tiger trotted up a jeweled driveway to the front door of
the palace and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said Dorothy, gaily, and helped Button-Bright from the
chariot. Polychrome leaped out lightly after them, and they were greeted
by a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants who bowed low as the visitors
mounted the marble steps. At their head was a pretty little maid with
dark hair and eyes, dressed all in green embroidered with silver.
Dorothy ran up to her with evident pleasure, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O Jellia Jamb! I'm so glad to see you again. Where's Ozma?"</p>

<p>"In her room, your Highness," replied the little maid demurely, for this
was Ozma's favorite attendant. "She wishes you to come to her as soon as
you have rested and changed your dress, Princess Dorothy. And you and
your friends are to dine with her this evening."</p>

<p>"When is her birthday, Jellia?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow, your Highness."</p>

<p>"And where's the Scarecrow?"</p>

<p>"He's gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff
himself with, in honor of Ozma's celebration," replied the maid. "He
returns to the Emerald City to-morrow, he said."</p>

<p>By this time Tik-tok, the Tin Woodman, and the shaggy man had arrived
and the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace, Billina going
with the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence from them.
But Toto stayed close beside Dorothy.</p>

alt="&quot;O, JELLIA JAMB! I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU&quot;" /><br />"O,
JELLIA JAMB! I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU"</p>

<p>"Come in, please," said Jellia Jamb; "it shall be our pleasant duty to
escort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use."</p>

<p>The shaggy man hesitated. Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed of
his shaggy looks before, but now that he was surrounded by so much
magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place.</p>

<p>Dorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozma's palace,
so he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy handkerchief and
entered the grand hall after the others.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i194.png"
width="550px"
height="355px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Tik-tok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the
same room whenever he visited Ozma, so these two went at once to remove
the dust of the journey from their shining bodies. Dorothy also had a
pretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the Emerald
City; but several servants walked ahead politely to show the way,
although she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself. She took
Button-Bright with her, because he seemed too small to be left alone in
such a big palace; but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the beautiful
Daughter of the Rainbow to her apartments, because it was easy to see
that Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was therefore entitled
to especial attention.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i196.png"

alt="The Shaggy Man's Welcome" /></p>

<p>THE shaggy man stood in the great hall, his shaggy hat in his hands,
wondering what would become of him. He had never been a guest in a fine
palace before; perhaps he had never been a guest anywhere. In the big,
cold, outside world people did not invite shaggy men to their homes, and
this shaggy man of ours had slept more in hay-lofts and stables than in
comfortable rooms. When the others left the great hall he eyed the
splendidly dressed servants of the Princess Ozma as if he expected to be
ordered out; but one of them bowed before him as respectfully as if he
had been a prince, and said:</p>

<p>"Permit me, sir, to conduct you to your apartments."</p>

<p>The shaggy man drew a long breath and took courage.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered; "I'm ready."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i197.png"
width="550px"
height="343px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Through the big hall they went, up the grand staircase carpeted thick
with velvet, and so along a wide corridor to a carved doorway. Here the
servant paused, and opening the door said with polite deference:</p>

<p>"Be good enough to enter, sir, and make yourself at home in the rooms
our Royal Ozma has ordered prepared for you. Whatever you see is for you
to use and enjoy, as if your own. The Princess dines at seven, and I
shall be here in time to lead you to the drawing-room, where you will be
privileged to meet the lovely Ruler of Oz. Is there any command, in the
meantime, with which you desire to honor me?"</p>

<p>"No," said the shaggy man; "but I'm much obliged."</p>

<p>He entered the room and shut the door, and for a time stood in
bewilderment, admiring the grandeur before him.</p>

<p>He had been given one of the handsomest apartments in the most
magnificent palace in the world, and you can not wonder that his good
fortune astonished and awed him until he grew used to his surroundings.</p>

<p>The furniture was upholstered in cloth of gold, with the royal crown
embroidered upon it in scarlet. The rug upon the marble floor was so
thick and soft that he could not hear the sound of his own footsteps,
and upon the walls were splendid tapestries woven with scenes from the
Land of Oz. Books and ornaments were scattered about in profusion, and
the shaggy man thought he had never seen so many pretty things in one
place before. In one corner played a tinkling fountain of perfumed
water, and in another was a table bearing a golden tray loaded with
freshly gathered fruit, including several of the red-cheeked apples that
the shaggy man loved.</p>

<p>At the farther end of this charming room was an open doorway, and he
crossed over to find himself in a bedroom containing more comforts than
the shaggy man had ever before imagined. The bedstead was of gold and
set with many brilliant diamonds, and the coverlet had designs of
pearls and rubies sewed upon it. At one side of the bedroom was a dainty
dressing-room, with closets containing a large assortment of fresh
clothing; and beyond this was the bath&mdash;a large room having a marble
pool big enough to swim in, with white marble steps leading down to the
water. Around the edge of the pool were set rows of fine emeralds as
large as door-knobs, while the water of the bath was clear as crystal.</p>

alt="THE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRES HIS NEW CLOTHES" /><br />THE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRES HIS NEW CLOTHES</p>

<p>For a time the shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent
amazement. Then he decided, being wise in his way, to take advantage of
his good fortune. He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy clothing,
and bathed in the pool with rare enjoyment. After he had dried himself
with the soft towels he went into the dressing-room and took fresh linen
from the drawers and put it on, finding that everything fitted him
exactly. He examined the contents of the closets and selected an elegant
suit of clothing. Strangely enough, everything about it was shaggy,
although so new and beautiful, and he sighed with contentment to realize
that he could now be finely dressed and still be the Shaggy Man. His
coat was of rose-colored velvet, trimmed with shags and bobtails, with
buttons of blood-red rubies and golden shags around the edges. His vest
was a shaggy satin of a delicate cream color, and his knee-breeches of
rose velvet trimmed like the coat. Shaggy creamy stockings of silk, and
shaggy slippers of rose leather with ruby buckles, completed his
costume, and when he was thus attired the shaggy man looked at himself
in a long mirror with great admiration. On a table he found a
mother-of-pearl chest decorated with delicate silver vines and flowers
of clustered rubies, and on the cover was a silver plate engraved with
these words:</p>

<div class="box5"><p class="c">
<span class="jack">THE SHAGGY MAN:</span><br /><span class="smcap">HIS BOX OF ORNAMENTS</span></p></div>

<p>The chest was not locked, so he opened it and was almost dazzled by the
brilliance of the rich jewels it contained. After admiring the pretty
things, he took out a fine golden watch with a big chain, several
handsome finger-rings, and an ornament of rubies to pin upon the breast
of his shaggy shirt-bosom. Having carefully brushed his hair and
whiskers all the wrong way, to make them look as shaggy as possible, the
shaggy man breathed a deep sigh of joy and decided he was ready to meet
the Royal Princess as soon as she sent for him. While he waited he
returned to the beautiful sitting room and ate several of the
red-cheeked apples to pass away the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dorothy had dressed herself in a pretty gown of soft grey
embroidered with silver, and put a blue-and-gold suit of satin upon
little Button-Bright, who looked as sweet as a cherub in it. Followed
by the boy and Toto&mdash;the dog with a new green ribbon around his
neck&mdash;she hastened down to the splendid drawing-room of the palace,
where, seated upon an exquisite throne of carved malachite and nestled
amongst its green satin cushions was the lovely Princess Ozma, waiting
eagerly to welcome her friend.</p>

alt="Princess Ozma of Oz" /></p>


<p>THE royal historians of Oz, who are fine writers and know any number of
big words, have often tried to describe the rare beauty of Ozma and
failed because the words were not good enough. So of course I can not
hope to tell you how great was the charm of this little Princess, or how
her loveliness put to shame all the sparkling jewels and magnificent
luxury that surrounded her in this her royal palace. Whatever else was
beautiful or dainty or delightful of itself faded to dullness when
contrasted with Ozma's bewitching face, and it has often been said by
those who know that no other ruler in all the world can ever hope to
equal the gracious charm of her manner.</p>

<p>Everything about Ozma attracted one, and she inspired love and the
sweetest affection rather than awe or ordinary admiration. Dorothy threw
her arms around her little friend and hugged and kissed her rapturously,
and Toto barked joyfully and Button-Bright smiled a happy smile and
consented to sit on the soft cushions close beside the Princess.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you send me word you were going to have a birthday party?"
asked the little Kansas girl, when the first greetings were over.</p>

<p>"Didn't I?" asked Ozma, her pretty eyes dancing with merriment.</p>

<p>"Did you?" replied Dorothy, trying to think.</p>

<p>"Who do you imagine, dear, mixed up those roads, so as to start you
wandering in the direction of Oz?" inquired the Princess.</p>

<p>"Oh! I never 'spected <i>you</i> of that," cried Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I've watched you in my Magic Picture all the way here," declared Ozma,
"and twice I thought I should have to use the Magic Belt to save you and
transport you to the Emerald City. Once was when the Scoodlers caught
you, and again when you reached the Deadly Desert. But the shaggy man
was able to help you out both times, so I did not interfere."</p>

<p>"Do you know who Button-Bright is?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i205.png"
width="550px"
height="352px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"No; I never saw him until you found him in the road, and then only in
my Magic Picture."</p>

<p>"And did you send Polly to us?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; the Rainbow's Daughter slid from her father's pretty arch
just in time to meet you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Dorothy, "I've promised King Dox of Foxville and King
Kik-a-bray of Dunkiton that I'd ask you to invite them to your party."</p>

<p>"I have already done that," returned Ozma, "because I thought it would
please you to favor them."</p>

<p>"Did you 'vite the Musicker?" asked Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"No; because he would be too noisy, and might interfere with the comfort
of others. When music is not very good, and is indulged in all the
time, it is better that the performer should be alone," said the
Princess.</p>

<p>"I like the Musicker's music," declared the boy, gravely.</p>

<p>"But I don't," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Well, there will be plenty of music at my celebration," promised Ozma;
"so I've an idea Button-Bright won't miss the Musicker at all."</p>

<p>Just then Polychrome danced in, and Ozma rose to greet the Rainbow's
Daughter in her sweetest and most cordial manner.</p>

<p>Dorothy thought she had never seen two prettier creatures together than
these lovely maidens; but Polly knew at once her own dainty beauty could
not match that of Ozma, yet was not a bit jealous because this was so.</p>

<p>The Wizard of Oz was announced, and a dried-up, little, old man, clothed
all in black, entered the drawing-room. His face was cheery and his eyes
twinkling with humor, so Polly and Button-Bright were not at all afraid
of the wonderful personage whose fame as a humbug magician had spread
throughout the world. After greeting Dorothy with much affection, he
stood modestly behind Ozma's throne and listened to the lively prattle
of the young people.</p>

<p>Now the shaggy man appeared, and so startling was his appearance, all
clad in shaggy new raiment, that Dorothy cried "Oh!" and clasped her
hands impulsively as she examined her friend with pleased eyes.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i207.png"
width="550px"
height="357px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"He's still shaggy, all right," remarked Button-Bright; and Ozma nodded
brightly because she had meant the shaggy man to remain shaggy when she
provided his new clothes for him.</p>

<p>Dorothy led him toward the throne, as he was shy in such fine company,
and presented him gracefully to the Princess, saying:</p>

<p>"This, your Highness, is my friend, the shaggy man, who owns the Love
Magnet."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to Oz," said the girl Ruler, in gracious accents. "But
tell me, sir, where did you get the Love Magnet which you say you own?"</p>

<p>The shaggy man grew red and looked downcast, as he answered in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"I stole it, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Oh, Shaggy Man!" cried Dorothy. "How dreadful! And you told me the
Eskimo gave you the Love Magnet."</p>

<p>He shuffled first on one foot and then on the other, much embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I told you a falsehood, Dorothy," he said; "but now, having bathed in
the Truth Pond, I must tell nothing but the truth."</p>

<p>"Why did you steal it?" asked Ozma, gently.</p>

<p>"Because no one loved me, or cared for me," said the shaggy man, "and I
wanted to be loved a great deal. It was owned by a girl in Butterfield
who was loved too much, so that the young men quarreled over her, which
made her unhappy. After I had stolen the Magnet from her, only one young
man continued to love the girl, and she married him and regained her
happiness."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry you stole it?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"No, your Highness; I'm glad," he answered; "for it has pleased me to be
loved, and if Dorothy had not cared for me I could not have accompanied
her to this beautiful Land of Oz, or met its kind-hearted Ruler. Now
that I'm here, I hope to remain, and to become one of your Majesty's
most faithful subjects."</p>

<p>"But in Oz we are loved for ourselves alone, and for our kindness to one
another, and for our good deeds," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll give up the Love Magnet," said the shaggy man, eagerly; "Dorothy
shall have it."</p>

<p>"But every one loves Dorothy already," declared the Wizard.</p>

<p>"Then Button-Bright shall have it."</p>

<p>"Don't want it," said the boy, promptly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll give it to the Wizard, for I'm sure the lovely Princess Ozma
does not need it."</p>

<p>"All my people love the Wizard, too," announced the Princess, laughing;
"so we will hang the Love Magnet over the gates of the Emerald City,
that whoever shall enter or leave the gates may be loved and loving."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," said the shaggy man; "I agree to it most
willingly."</p>

<p>Those assembled now went in to dinner, which you may imagine was a grand
affair; and afterward Ozma asked the Wizard to give them an exhibition
of his magic.</p>

<p>The Wizard took eight tiny white piglets from an inside pocket and set
them on the table. One was dressed like a clown, and performed funny
antics, and the others leaped over the spoons and dishes and ran around
the table like racehorses, and turned hand-springs and were so
sprightly and amusing that they kept the company in one roar of merry
laughter. The Wizard had trained these pets to do many curious things,
and they were so little and so cunning and soft that Polychrome loved to
pick them up as they passed near her place and fondle them as if they
were kittens.</p>

<p>It was late when the entertainment ended, and they separated to go to
their rooms.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i211.png"

<p>"To-morrow," said Ozma, "my invited guests will arrive, and you will
find among them some interesting and curious people, I promise you. The
next day will be my birthday, and the festivities will be held on the
broad green just outside the gates of the City, where all my people can
assemble without being crowded."</p>

<p>"I hope the Scarecrow won't be late," said Dorothy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is sure to return to-morrow," answered Ozma. "He wanted new
straw to stuff himself with, so he went to the Munchkin Country, where
straw is plentiful."</p>

<p>With this the Princess bade her guests good night and went to her own
room.</p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i213.png"

<p>NEXT morning Dorothy's breakfast was served in her own pretty sitting
room, and she sent to invite Polly and the shaggy man to join her and
Button-Bright at the meal. They came gladly, and Toto also had breakfast
with them, so that the little party that had traveled together to Oz was
once more reunited.</p>

<p>No sooner had they finished eating than they heard the distant blast of
many trumpets, and the sound of a brass band playing martial music; so
they all went out upon the balcony. This was at the front of the palace
and overlooked the streets of the City, being higher than the wall that
shut in the palace grounds. They saw approaching down the street a band
of musicians, playing as hard and loud as they could, while the people
of the Emerald City crowded the sidewalks and cheered so lustily that
they almost drowned the noise of the drums and horns.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i214.png"
width="550px"
height="356px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>Dorothy looked to see what they were cheering at, and discovered that
behind the band was the famous Scarecrow, riding proudly upon the back
of a wooden Saw-Horse which pranced along the street almost as
gracefully as if it had been made of flesh. Its hoofs, or rather the
ends of its wooden legs, were shod with plates of solid gold, and the
saddle strapped to the wooden body was richly embroidered and glittered
with jewels.</p>

<p>As he reached the palace the Scarecrow looked up and saw Dorothy, and at
once waved his peaked hat at her in greeting. He rode up to the front
door and dismounted, and the band stopped playing and went away and the
crowds of people returned to their dwellings.</p>

<p>By the time Dorothy and her friends had re-entered her room the
Scarecrow was there, and he gave the girl a hearty embrace and shook the
hands of the others with his own squashy hands, which were white gloves
filled with straw.</p>

<p>The shaggy man, Button-Bright, and Polychrome stared hard at this
celebrated person, who was acknowledged to be the most popular and most
beloved man in all the Land of Oz.</p>

<p>"Why, your face has been newly painted!" exclaimed Dorothy, when the
first greetings were over.</p>

<p>"I had it touched up a bit by the Munchkin farmer who first made me,"
answered the Scarecrow, pleasantly. "My complexion had become a bit grey
and faded, you know, and the paint had peeled off one end of my mouth,
so I couldn't talk quite straight. Now I feel like myself again, and I
may say without immodesty that my body is stuffed with the loveliest
oat-straw in all Oz." He pushed against his chest. "Hear me crunkle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dorothy; "you sound fine."</p>

<p>Button-Bright was wonderfully attracted by the straw man, and so was
Polly. The shaggy man treated him with great respect, because he was so
queerly made.</p>

<p>Jellia Jamb now came to say that Ozma wanted Princess Dorothy to receive
the invited guests in the Throne-Room, as they arrived. The Ruler was
herself busy ordering the preparations for the morrow's festivities, so
she wished her friend to act in her place.</p>

<p>Dorothy willingly agreed, being the only other Princess in the Emerald
City; so she went to the great Throne-Room and sat in Ozma's seat,
placing Polly on one side of her and Button-Bright on the other. The
Scarecrow stood at the left of the throne and the Tin Woodman at the
right, while the Wonderful Wizard and the shaggy man stood behind.</p>

<p>The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger came in, with bright new bows of
ribbon on their collars and tails. After greeting Dorothy affectionately
the huge beasts lay down at the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>While they waited, the Scarecrow, who was near the little boy, asked:</p>

<p>"Why are you called Button-Bright?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do, dear," said Dorothy. "Tell the Scarecrow how you got
your name."</p>

<p>"Papa always said I was bright as a button, so mamma always called me
Button-Bright," announced the boy.</p>

<p>"Where is your mamma?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Where is your home?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to find your mamma again?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright, calmly.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Your papa may have been right," he observed; "but there are many kinds
of buttons, you see. There are silver and gold buttons, which are highly
polished and glitter brightly. There are pearl and rubber buttons, and
other kinds, with surfaces more or less bright. But there is still
another sort of button which is covered with dull cloth, and that must
be the sort your papa meant when he said you were bright as a button.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>Jack Pumpkinhead arrived, wearing a pair of new white kid gloves; and he
brought a birthday present for Ozma consisting of a necklace of
pumpkin-seeds. In each seed was set a sparkling carolite, which is
considered the rarest and most beautiful gem that exists. The necklace
was in a plush case and Jellia Jamb put it on a table with the Princess
Ozma's other presents.</p>

<p>Next came a tall, beautiful woman clothed in a splendid trailing gown,
trimmed with exquisite lace as fine as cobweb. This was the important
Sorceress known as Glinda the Good, who had been of great assistance to
both Ozma and Dorothy. There was no humbug about her magic, you may be
sure, and Glinda was as kind as she was powerful. She greeted Dorothy
most lovingly, and kissed Button-Bright and Polly, and smiled upon the
shaggy man, after which Jellia Jamb led the Sorceress to one of the most
magnificent rooms of the royal palace and appointed fifty servants to
wait upon her.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i218.png"
width="550px"
height="352px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>The next arrival was Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.; the "H. M." meaning
Highly Magnified and the "T. E." meaning Thoroughly Educated. The
Woggle-Bug was head professor at the Royal College of Oz, and he had
composed a fine Ode in honor of Ozma's birthday. This he wanted to read
to them; but the Scarecrow wouldn't let him.</p>

<p>Soon they heard a clucking sound and a chorus of "cheep! cheep!" and a
servant threw open the door to allow Billina and her ten fluffy chicks
to enter the Throne-Room. As the Yellow Hen marched proudly at the head
of her family, Dorothy cried, "Oh, you lovely things!" and ran down from
her seat to pet the little yellow downy balls. Billina wore a pearl
necklace, and around the neck of each chicken was a tiny gold chain
holding a locket with the letter "D" engraved upon the outside.</p>

<p>"Open the lockets, Dorothy," said Billina. The girl obeyed and found a
picture of herself in each locket. "They were named after you, my dear,"
continued the Yellow Hen, "so I wanted all my chickens to wear your
picture. Cluck&mdash;cluck! come here, Dorothy&mdash;this minute!" she cried, for
the chickens were scattered and wandering all around the big room.</p>

<p>They obeyed the call at once, and came running as fast as they could,
fluttering their fluffy wings in a laughable way.</p>

<p>It was lucky that Billina gathered the little ones under her soft breast
just then, for Tik-tok came in and tramped up to the throne on his flat
copper feet.</p>

<p>"I am all wound up and work-ing fine-ly," said the clockwork man to
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I can hear him tick," declared Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"You are quite the polished gentleman," said the Tin Woodman. "Stand up
here beside the shaggy man, Tik-tok, and help receive the company."</p>

<p>Dorothy placed soft cushions in a corner for Billina and her chicks, and
had just returned to the Throne and seated herself when the playing of
the royal band outside the palace announced the approach of
distinguished guests.</p>

<p>And my, how they did stare when the High Chamberlain threw open the
doors and the visitors entered the Throne-Room!</p>

<p>First walked a gingerbread man, neatly formed and baked to a lovely
brown tint. He wore a silk hat and carried a candy cane prettily striped
with red and yellow. His shirt-front and cuffs were white frosting, and
the buttons on his coat were licorice drops.</p>

<p>Behind the gingerbread man came a child with flaxen hair and merry blue
eyes, dressed in white pajamas, with sandals on the soles of its pretty
bare feet. The child looked around smiling and thrust its hands into the
pockets of the pajamas. Close after it came a big rubber bear, walking
erect on its hind feet. The bear had twinkling black eyes and its body
looked as if it had been pumped full of air.</p>

<p>Following these curious visitors were two tall, thin men and two short,
fat men, all four dressed in gorgeous uniforms.</p>

alt="KING DOUGH, THE HEAD BOOLEYWAG, AND PARA BRUIN" /><br />KING DOUGH, THE HEAD BOOLEYWAG, AND PARA BRUIN</p>

<p>Ozma's High Chamberlain now hurried forward to announce the names of the
new arrivals, calling out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"His Gracious and Most Edible Majesty, King Dough the First, Ruler of
the Two Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland. Also the Head Booleywag of his
Majesty, known as Chick the Cherub, and their faithful friend Para
Bruin, the rubber bear."</p>

<p>These great personages bowed low as their names were called, and Dorothy
hastened to introduce them to the assembled company. They were the first
foreign arrivals, and the friends of Princess Ozma were polite to them
and tried to make them feel that they were welcome.</p>

<p>Chick the Cherub shook hands with every one, including Billina, and was
so joyous and frank and full of good spirits that John Dough's Head
Booleywag at once became a prime favorite.</p>

<p>"Is it a boy or a girl?" whispered Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>"Goodness me! what a queer lot of people you are," exclaimed the rubber
bear, looking at the assembled company.</p>

<p>"So're you," said Button-Bright, gravely. "Is King Dough good to eat?"</p>

<p>"He's too good to eat," laughed Chick the Cherub.</p>

<p>"I hope none of you are fond of gingerbread," said the King, rather
anxiously.</p>

<p>"We should never think of eating our visitors, if we were," declared the
Scarecrow; "so please do not worry, for you will be perfectly safe while
you remain in Oz."</p>

<p>"Why do they call you Chick?" the Yellow Hen asked the child.</p>

<p>"Because I'm an Incubator Baby, and never had any parents," replied the
Head Booleywag.</p>

<p>"My chicks have a parent, and I'm it," said Billina.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," answered the Cherub, "because they'll have more fun
worrying you than if they were brought up in an Incubator. The Incubator
never worries, you know."</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i223.png"
width="550px"
height="361px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>King John Dough had brought for Ozma's birthday present a lovely
gingerbread crown, with rows of small pearls around it and a fine big
pearl in each of its five points. After this had been received by
Dorothy with proper thanks and placed on the table with the other
presents, the visitors from Hiland and Loland were escorted to their
rooms by the High Chamberlain.</p>

<p>They had no sooner departed than the band before the palace began to
play again, announcing more arrivals, and as these were doubtless from
foreign parts the High Chamberlain hurried back to receive them in his
most official manner.</p>

<p><a name="CHAP_22" id="CHAP_22"></a></p>

<p class="img2"><img src="images/i225.png"
width="550px"
height="429px"
alt="Important Arrivals" /></p>

<p>FIRST entered a band of Ryls from the Happy Valley, all merry little
sprites like fairy elves. A dozen crooked Knooks followed from the great
Forest of Burzee. They had long whiskers and pointed caps and curling
toes, yet were no taller than Button-Bright's shoulder. With this group
came a man so easy to recognize and so important and dearly beloved
throughout the known world, that all present rose to their feet and
bowed their heads in respectful homage, even before the High Chamberlain
knelt to announce his name.</p>

<p>"The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme
Highness&mdash;Santa Claus!" said the Chamberlain, in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well! Glad to see you&mdash;glad to meet you all!" cried Santa
Claus, briskly, as he trotted up the long room.</p>

<p>He was round as an apple, with a fresh rosy face, laughing eyes, and a
bushy beard as white as snow. A red cloak trimmed with beautiful ermine
hung from his shoulders and upon his back was a basket filled with
pretty presents for the Princess Ozma.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dorothy; still having adventures?" he asked in his jolly way, as
he took the girl's hand in both his own.</p>

<p>"How did you know my name, Santa?" she replied, feeling more shy in the
presence of this immortal saint than she ever had before in her young
life.</p>

<p>"Why, don't I see you every Christmas Eve, when you're asleep?" he
rejoined, pinching her blushing cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh; do you?"</p>

<p>"And here's Button-Bright, I declare!" cried Santa Claus, holding up the
boy to kiss him. "What a long way from home you are; dear me!"</p>

<p>"Do you know Button-Bright, too?" questioned Dorothy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. I've visited his home several Christmas Eves."</p>

<p>"And do you know his father?" asked the girl.</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i227.png"
style="border: double 10px black;"
width="550px"

alt="MERRY RYLS AND CROOKED KNOOKS" /><br />MERRY RYLS AND CROOKED KNOOKS</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear. Who else do you suppose brings him his Christmas
neckties and stockings?" with a sly wink at the Wizard.</p>

<p>"Then where does he live? We're just crazy to know, 'cause
Button-Bright's lost," she said.</p>

<p>Santa laughed and laid his finger aside of his nose as if thinking what
to reply. He leaned over and whispered something in the Wizard's ear, at
which the Wizard smiled and nodded as if he understood.</p>

<p>Now Santa Claus spied Polychrome, and trotted over to where she stood.</p>

<p>"Seems to me the Rainbow's Daughter is farther from home than any of
you," he observed, looking at the pretty maiden admiringly. "I'll have
to tell your father where you are, Polly, and send him to get you."</p>

<p>"Please do, dear Santa Claus," implored the little maid, beseechingly.</p>

<p>"But just now we must all have a jolly good time at Ozma's party," said
the old gentlemen, turning to put his presents on the table with the
others already there. "It isn't often I find time to leave my castle, as
you know; but Ozma invited me and I just couldn't help coming to
celebrate the happy occasion."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"These are my Ryls," pointing to the little sprites squatting around
him. "Their business is to paint the colors of the flowers when they
bud and bloom; but I brought the merry fellows along to see Oz, and
they've left their paint-pots behind them. Also I brought these crooked
Knooks, whom I love. My dears, the Knooks are much nicer than they look,
for their duty is to water and care for the young trees of the forest,
and they do their work faithfully and well. It's hard work, though, and
it makes my Knooks crooked and gnarled, like the trees themselves; but
their hearts are big and kind, as are the hearts of all who do good in
our beautiful world."</p>

<p>"I've read of the Ryls and Knooks," said Dorothy, looking upon these
little workers with interest.</p>

<p>Santa Claus turned to talk with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and
he also said a kind word to the shaggy man, and afterward went away to
ride the Saw-horse around the Emerald City. "For," said he, "I must see
all the grand sights while I am here and have the chance, and Ozma has
promised to let me ride the Saw-Horse because I'm getting fat and short
of breath."</p>

<p>"Where are your reindeer?" asked Polychrome.</p>

<p>"I left them at home, for it is too warm for them in this sunny
country," he answered. "They're used to winter weather when they
travel."</p>

<p>In a flash he was gone, and the Ryls and Knooks with him; but they could
all hear the golden hoofs of the Saw-Horse ringing on the marble
pavement outside, as he pranced away with his noble rider.</p>

<p>Presently the band played again, and the High Chamberlain announced:</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i230.png"
width="550px"
height="354px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"Her Gracious Majesty, the Queen of Merryland."</p>

<p>They looked earnestly to discover whom this queen might be, and saw
advancing up the room an exquisite wax doll, dressed in dainty fluffs
and ruffles and spangled gown. She was almost as big as Button-Bright,
and her cheeks and mouth and eyebrow were prettily painted in delicate
colors. Her blue eyes stared a bit, being of glass, yet the expression
upon her Majesty's face was quite pleasant and decidedly winning. With
the Queen of Merryland were four wooden soldiers, two stalking ahead of
her with much dignity and two following behind, like a royal bodyguard.
The soldiers were painted in bright colors and carried wooden guns, and
after them came a fat little man who attracted attention at once,
although he seemed modest and retiring. For he was made of candy, and
carried a tin sugar-sifter filled with powdered sugar, with which he
dusted himself frequently so that he wouldn't stick to things if he
touched them. The High Chamberlain had called him "The Candy Man of
Merryland," and Dorothy saw that one of his thumbs looked as if it had
been bitten off by some who was fond of candy and couldn't resist the
temptation.</p>

<p>The wax doll Queen spoke prettily to Dorothy and the others, and sent
her loving greetings to Ozma before she retired to the rooms prepared
for her. She had brought a birthday present wrapped in tissue paper and
tied with pink and blue ribbons, and one of the wooden soldiers placed
it on the table with the other gifts. But the Candy Man did not go to
his room, because he said he preferred to stay and talk with the
Scarecrow and Tik-tok and the Wizard and Tin Woodman, whom he declared
the queerest people he had ever met. Button-Bright was glad the Candy
Man stayed in the Throne-room, because the boy thought this guest
smelled deliciously of wintergreen and maple sugar.</p>

<p>The Braided Man now entered the room, having been fortunate enough to
receive an invitation to the Princess Ozma's party. He was from a cave
halfway between the Invisible Valley and the Country of the Gargoyles,
and his hair and whiskers were so long that he was obliged to plait them
into many braids that hung to his feet, and every braid was tied with a
bow of colored ribbon.</p>

<p>"I've brought Princess Ozma a box of flutters for her birthday," said
the Braided Man, earnestly; "and I hope she will like them, for they are
the finest quality I have ever made."</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i232.png"
width="550px"
height="357px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>"I'm sure she will be greatly pleased," said Dorothy, who remembered
the Braided Man well; and the Wizard introduced the guest to the rest of
the company and made him sit down in a chair and keep quiet, for, if
allowed, he would talk continually about his flutters.</p>

<p>The band then played a welcome to another set of guests, and into the
Throne-Room swept the handsome and stately Queen of Ev. Beside her was
young King Evardo, and following them came the entire royal family of
five Princesses and four Princes of Ev. The Kingdom of Ev lay just
across the Deadly Desert to the North of Oz, and once Ozma and her
people had rescued the Queen of Ev and her ten children from the Nome
King, who had enslaved them. Dorothy had been present on this adventure,
so she greeted the royal family cordially; and all the visitors were
delighted to meet the little Kansas girl again. They knew Tik-tok and
Billina, too, and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, as well as the Lion and
Tiger; so there was a joyful reunion, as you may imagine, and it was
fully an hour before the Queen and her train retired to their rooms.
Perhaps they would not have gone then had not the band begun to play to
announce new arrivals; but before they left the great Throne-Room King
Evardo added to Ozma's birthday presents a diadem of diamonds set in
radium.</p>

<p>The next comer proved to be King Renard of Foxville; or King Dox, as he
preferred to be called. He was magnificently dressed in a new feather
costume and wore white kid mittens over his paws and a flower in his
button-hole and had his hair parted in the middle.</p>

<p>King Dox thanked Dorothy fervently for getting him the invitation to
come to Oz, which he had all his life longed to visit. He strutted
around rather absurdly as he was introduced to all the famous people
assembled in the Throne-Room, and when he learned that Dorothy was a
Princess of Oz the Fox King insisted on kneeling at her feet and
afterward retired backward&mdash;a dangerous thing to do, as he might have
stubbed his paw and tumbled over.</p>

<p>No sooner was he gone than the blasts of bugles and clatter of drums and
cymbals announced important visitors, and the High Chamberlain assumed
his most dignified tone as he threw open the door and said proudly:</p>

<p>"Her Sublime and Resplendent Majesty, Queen Zixi of Ix! His Serene and
Tremendous Majesty, King Bud of Noland. Her Royal Highness, the Princess
Fluff."</p>


<p class="img"><img src="images/i235.png"
style="border:double 10px black;"
width="550px"
height="785px"
alt="HER MAJESTY, QUEEN ZIXI OF IX" /><br />HER MAJESTY, QUEEN ZIXI OF IX</p>

<p>That three such high and mighty royal personages should arrive at once
was enough to make Dorothy and her companions grow solemn and assume
their best company manners; but when the exquisite beauty of Queen Zixi
met their eyes they thought they had never beheld anything so charming.
Dorothy decided that Zixi must be about sixteen years old, but the
Wizard whispered to her that this wonderful queen had lived thousands
of years, but knew the secret of remaining always fresh and beautiful.</p>

<p>King Bud of Noland and his dainty fair-haired sister, the Princess
Fluff, were friends of Zixi, as their kingdoms were adjoining, so they
had traveled together from their far-off domains to do honor to Ozma of
Oz on the occasion of her birthday. They brought many splendid gifts; so
the table was now fairly loaded down with presents.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Polly loved the Princess Fluff the moment they saw her, and
little King Bud was so frank and boyish that Button-Bright accepted him
as a chum at once and did not want him to go away. But it was after noon
now, and the royal guests must prepare their toilets for the grand
banquet at which they were to assemble that evening to meet the reigning
Princess of this Fairyland; so Queen Zixi was shown to her room by a
troop of maidens led by Jellia Jamb, and Bud and Fluff presently
withdrew to their own apartments.</p>

<p>"My! what a big party Ozma is going to have," exclaimed Dorothy. "I
guess the palace will be chock full, Button-Bright; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said the boy.</p>

<p>"But we must go to our rooms, pretty soon, to dress for the banquet,"
continued the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't have to dress," said the Candy Man from Merryland. "All I need
do is to dust myself with fresh sugar."</p>

<p>"Tik-tok and I always wear the same suits of clothes," said the Tin
Woodman; "and so does our friend the Scarecrow."</p>

<p>"My feathers are good enough for any occasion," cried Billina, from her
corner.</p>

<p>"Then I shall leave you four to welcome any new guests that come," said
Dorothy; "for Button-Bright and I must look our very best at Ozma's
banquet."</p>

<p>"Who is still to come?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Well, there's King Kika-bray of Dunkiton, and Johnny Dooit, and the
Good Witch of the North. But Johnny Dooit may not get here until late,
he's so very busy."</p>

<p>"We will receive them and give them a proper welcome," promised the
Scarecrow. "So run along, little Dorothy, and get yourself dressed."</p>

<p>I WISH I could tell you how fine the company was that assembled that
evening at Ozma's royal banquet. A long table was spread in the center
of the great dining-hall of the palace and the splendor of the
decorations and the blaze of lights and jewels was acknowledged to be
the most magnificent sight that any of the guests had ever seen.</p>

<p>The jolliest person present, as well as the most important, was of
course, old Santa Claus; so he was given the seat of honor at one end of
the table while at the other end sat Princess Ozma, the hostess.</p>

<p>John Dough, Queen Zixi, King Bud, the Queen of Ev and her son Evardo,
and the Queen of Merryland had golden thrones to sit in, while the
others were supplied with beautiful chairs.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i240.png"
width="550px"
height="371px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>At the upper end of the banquet room was a separate table provided for
the animals. Toto sat at one end of this table, with a bib tied around
his neck and a silver platter to eat from. At the other end was placed a
small stand, with a low rail around the edge of it, for Billina and her
chicks. The rail kept the ten little Dorothys from falling off the
stand, while the Yellow Hen could easily reach over and take her food
from her tray upon the table. At other places sat the Hungry Tiger, the
Cowardly Lion, the Saw-Horse, the Rubber Bear, the Fox King and the
Donkey King; they made quite a company of animals.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the great room was another table, at which sat the
Ryls and Knooks who had come with Santa Claus, the wooden soldiers who
had come with the Queen of Merryland, and the Hilanders and Lolanders
who had come with John Dough. Here were also seated the officers of the
royal palace and of Ozma's army.</p>

<p>The splendid costumes of those at the three tables made a gorgeous and
glittering display that no one present was ever likely to forget;
perhaps there has never been in any part of the world at any time
another assemblage of such wonderful people as that which gathered this
evening to honor the birthday of the Ruler of Oz.</p>

<p>When all the members of the company were in their places an orchestra of
five hundred pieces, in a balcony overlooking the banquet room, began to
play sweet and delightful music. Then a door draped with royal green
opened, and in came the fair and girlish Princess Ozma, who now greeted
her guests in person for the first time.</p>

<p>As she stood by her throne at the head of the banquet table every eye
was turned eagerly upon the lovely Princess, who was as dignified as she
was bewitching, and who smiled upon all her old and new friends in a
way that touched their hearts and brought an answering smile to every
face.</p>

<p>Each guest had been served with a crystal goblet filled with lacasa,
which is a sort of nectar famous in Oz and nicer to drink than
soda-water or lemonade. Santa now made a pretty speech in verse,
congratulating Ozma on having a birthday, and asking every one present
to drink to the health and happiness of their dearly beloved hostess.
This was done with great enthusiasm by those who were made so they could
drink at all, and those who could not drink politely touched the rims of
their goblets to their lips. All seated themselves at the tables and the
servants of the Princess began serving the feast.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that only in Fairyland could such a delicious repast be
prepared. The dishes were of precious metals set with brilliant jewels
and the good things to eat which were placed upon them were countless in
number and of exquisite flavor. Several present, such as the Candy Man,
the Rubber Bear, Tik-tok, and the Scarecrow, were not made so they could
eat, and the Queen of Merryland contented herself with a small dish of
sawdust; but these enjoyed the pomp and glitter of the gorgeous scene as
much as did those who feasted.</p>

<p>The Woggle-Bug read his "Ode to Ozma," which was written in very good
rhythm and was well received by the company. The Wizard added to the
entertainment by making a big pie appear before Dorothy, and when the
little girl cut the pie the nine tiny piglets leaped out of it and
danced around the table, while the orchestra played a merry tune. This
amused the company very much, but they were even more pleased when
Polychrome, whose hunger had been easily satisfied, rose from the table
and performed her graceful and bewildering Rainbow Dance for them. When
it was ended the people clapped their hands and the animals clapped
their paws, while Billina cackled and the Donkey King brayed approval.</p>

<p>Johnny Dooit was present, and of course he proved he could do wonders in
the way of eating, as well as in everything else that he undertook to
do; the Tin Woodman sang a love song, every one joining in the chorus;
and the wooden soldiers from Merryland gave an exhibition of a lightning
drill with their wooden muskets; the Ryls and Knooks danced the Fairy
Circle; and the Rubber Bear bounced himself all around the room. There
was laughter and merriment on every side, and everybody was having a
royal good time. Button-Bright was so excited and interested that he
paid little attention to his fine dinner and a great deal of attention
to his queer companions; and perhaps he was wise to do this, because he
could eat at any other time.</p>

<p>The feasting and merrymaking continued until late in the evening, when
they separated to meet again the next morning and take part in the
birthday celebration, to which this royal banquet was merely the
introduction.</p>

<p>A CLEAR, perfect day, with a gentle breeze and a sunny sky, greeted
Princess Ozma as she wakened next morning, the anniversary of her birth.
While it was yet early all the city was astir and crowds of people came
from all parts of the Land of Oz to witness the festivities in honor of
their girl Ruler's birthday.</p>

<p>The noted visitors from foreign countries, who had all been transported
to the Emerald City by means of the Magic Belt, were as much a show to
the Ozites as were their own familiar celebrities, and the streets
leading from the royal palace to the jeweled gates were thronged with
men, women, and children to see the procession as it passed out to the
green fields where the ceremonies were to take place.</p>

<p>And what a great procession it was!</p>

<p>First came a thousand young girls&mdash;the prettiest in the land&mdash;dressed in
white muslin, with green sashes and hair ribbons, bearing great baskets
of red roses. As they walked they scattered these flowers upon the
marble pavements, so that the way was carpeted thick with roses for the
procession to walk upon.</p>

<p>Then came the Rulers of the four Kingdoms of Oz; the Emperor of the
Winkies, the Monarch of the Munchkins, the King of the Quadlings and the
Sovereign of the Gillikins, each wearing a long chain of emeralds around
his neck to show that he was a vassal of the Ruler of the Emerald City.</p>

<p>Next marched the Emerald City Cornet Band, clothed in green-and-gold
uniforms and playing the "Ozma Two-Step." The Royal Army of Oz followed,
consisting of twenty-seven officers, from the Captain-General down to
the Lieutenants. There were no privates in Ozma's Army because soldiers
were not needed to fight battles, but only to look important, and an
officer always looks more imposing than a private.</p>

<p>While the people cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs, there
came walking the Royal Princess Ozma, looking so pretty and sweet that
it is no wonder her people love her so dearly. She had decided she
would not ride in her chariot that day, as she preferred to walk in the
procession with her favored subjects and her guests. Just in front of
her trotted the living Blue Bear Rug owned by old Dyna, which wobbled
clumsily on its four feet because there was nothing but the skin to
support them, with a stuffed head at one end and a stubby tail at the
other. But whenever Ozma paused in her walk the Bear Rug would flop down
flat upon the ground for the princess to stand upon until she resumed
her progress.</p>

<p>Following the Princess stalked her two enormous beasts, the Cowardly
Lion and the Hungry Tiger, and even if the Army had not been there these
two would have been powerful enough to guard their mistress from any
harm.</p>

<p>Next marched the invited guests, who were loudly cheered by the people
of Oz along the road, and were therefore obliged to bow to right and
left almost every step of the way. First was Santa Claus, who, because
he was fat and not used to walking, rode the wonderful Saw-Horse. The
merry old gentleman had a basket of small toys with him, and he tossed
the toys one by one to the children as he passed by. His Ryls and Knooks
marched close behind him.</p>

<p>Queen Zixi of Ix came after; then John Dough and the Cherub, with the
rubber bear named Para Bruin strutting between them on its hind legs;
then the Queen of Merryland, escorted by her wooden soldiers; then King
Bud of Noland and his sister, the Princess Fluff; then the Queen of Ev
and her ten royal children; then the Braided Man and the Candy Man, side
by side; then King Dox of Foxville and King Kik-a-bray of Dunkiton, who
by this time had become good friends; and finally Johnny Dooit, in his
leather apron, smoking his long pipe.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i249.png"
width="550px"
height="347px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>These wonderful personages were not more heartily cheered by the people
than were those who followed after them in the procession. Dorothy was a
general favorite, and she walked arm in arm with the Scarecrow, who was
beloved by all. Then came Polychrome and Button-Bright, and the people
loved the Rainbow's pretty Daughter and the beautiful blue-eyed boy as
soon as they saw them. The shaggy man in his shaggy new suit attracted
much attention because he was such a novelty. With regular steps tramped
the machine-man Tik-tok, and there was more cheering when the Wizard of
Oz followed in the procession. The Woggle-Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead were
next, and behind them Glinda the Sorceress and the Good Witch of the
North. Finally came Billina, with her brood of chickens to whom she
clucked anxiously to keep them together and to hasten them along so they
would not delay the procession.</p>

<p>Another band followed, this time the Tin Band of the Emperor of the
Winkies, playing a beautiful march called, "There's No Plate like Tin."
Then came the servants of the Royal Palace, in a long line, and behind
them all the people joined the procession and marched away through the
emerald gates and out upon the broad green.</p>

<p>Here had been erected a splendid pavilion, with a grandstand big enough
to seat all the royal party and those who had taken part in the
procession. Over the pavilion, which was of green silk and cloth of
gold, countless banners waved in the breeze. Just in front of this, and
connected with it by a runway, had been built a broad platform, so that
all the spectators could see plainly the entertainment provided for
them.</p>

<p>The Wizard now became Master of Ceremonies, as Ozma had placed the
conduct of the performance in his hands. After the people had all
congregated about the platform and the royal party and the visitors were
seated in the grandstand, the Wizard skillfully performed some feats of
juggling glass balls and lighted candles. He tossed a dozen or so of
them high in the air and caught them one by one as they came down,
without missing any.</p>

<p>Then he introduced the Scarecrow, who did a sword-swallowing act that
aroused much interest. After this the Tin Woodman gave an exhibition of
Swinging the Axe, which he made to whirl around him so rapidly that the
eye could scarcely follow the motion of the gleaming blade. Glinda the
Sorceress then stepped upon the platform, and by her magic made a big
tree grow in the middle of the space, made blossoms appear upon the
tree, and made the blossoms become delicious fruit called tamornas; and
so great was the quantity of fruit thus produced that when the servants
climbed the tree and tossed it down to the crowd, there was enough to
satisfy every person present.</p>

<p>Para Bruin, the rubber bear, climbed to a limb of the big tree, rolled
himself into a ball, and dropped to the platform, whence he bounded up
again to the limb. He repeated this bouncing act several times, to the
great delight of all the children present. After he had finished, and
bowed, and returned to his seat, Glinda waved her wand and the tree
disappeared; but its fruit still remained to be eaten.</p>

<p>The Good Witch of the North amused the people by transforming ten stones
into ten birds, the ten birds into ten lambs, and the ten lambs into ten
little girls, who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed into ten
stones again, just as they were in the beginning.</p>

<p>Johnny Dooit next came on the platform with his tool-chest, and in a few
minutes built a great flying machine; then put his chest in the machine
and the whole thing flew away together&mdash;Johnny and all&mdash;after he had bid
good-bye to those present and thanked the Princess for her hospitality.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i252.png"
width="550px"
height="354px"
alt="image not available" /></p>

<p>The Wizard then announced the last act of all, which was considered
really wonderful. He had invented a machine to blow huge soap-bubbles,
as big as balloons, and this machine was hidden under the platform so
that only the rim of the big clay pipe to produce the bubbles showed
above the flooring. The tank of soap-suds, and the air-pumps to inflate
the bubbles, were out of sight beneath, so that when the bubbles began
to grow upon the floor of the platform it really seemed like magic to
the people of Oz, who knew nothing about even the common soap-bubbles
that our children blow with a penny clay pipe and a basin of
soap-and-water.</p>

<p>The Wizard had invented another thing. Usually soap-bubbles are frail
and burst easily, lasting only a few moments as they float in the air;
but the Wizard added a sort of glue to his soapsuds, which made his
bubbles tough; and, as the glue dried rapidly when exposed to the air,
the Wizard's bubbles were strong enough to float for hours without
breaking.</p>

<p>He began by blowing&mdash;by means of his machinery and air-pumps&mdash;several
large bubbles which he allowed to float upward into the sky, where the
sunshine fell upon them and gave them iridescent hues that were most
beautiful. This aroused much wonder and delight, because it was a new
amusement to every one present&mdash;except perhaps Dorothy and
Button-Bright, and even they had never seen such big, strong bubbles
before.</p>

alt="THE WIZARD BLEW A BUBBLE AROUND SANTA CLAUS" /><br />THE WIZARD BLEW A BUBBLE AROUND SANTA CLAUS</p>

<p>The Wizard then blew a bunch of small bubbles and afterward blew a big
bubble around them so they were left in the center of it; then he
allowed the whole mass of pretty globes to float into the air and
disappear in the far distant sky.</p>

<p>"That is really fine!" declared Santa Claus, who loved toys and pretty
things. "I think, Mr. Wizard, I shall have you blow a bubble around me;
then I can float away home and see the country spread out beneath me as
I travel. There isn't a spot on earth that I haven't visited, but I
usually go in the night-time, riding behind my swift reindeer. Here is a
good chance to observe the country by daylight, while I am riding slowly
and at my ease."</p>

<p>"Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble?" asked the Wizard.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I know enough magic to do that," replied Santa Claus. "You blow
the bubble, with me inside of it, and I'll be sure to get home in
safety."</p>

<p>"Please send me home in a bubble, too!" begged the Queen of Merryland.</p>

<p>"Very well, madam; you shall try the journey first," politely answered
old Santa.</p>

<p>The pretty wax doll bade good-bye to the Princess Ozma and the others,
and stood on the platform while the Wizard blew a big soap-bubble around
her. When completed he allowed the bubble to float slowly upward, and
there could be seen the little Queen of Merryland standing in the
middle of it and blowing kisses from her fingers to those below. The
bubble took a southerly direction, quickly floating out of sight.</p>

<p>"That's a very nice way to travel," said Princess Fluff. "I'd like to go
home in a bubble, too."</p>

<p>So the Wizard blew a big bubble around Princess Fluff, and another
around King Bud, her brother, and a third one around Queen Zixi; and
soon these three bubbles had mounted into the sky and were floating off
in a group in the direction of the kingdom of Noland.</p>

<p>The success of these ventures induced the other guests from foreign
lands to undertake bubble journeys, also; so the Wizard put them one by
one inside his bubbles, and Santa Claus directed the way they should go,
because he knew exactly where everybody lived.</p>

<p>Finally Button-Bright said:</p>

<p>"I want to go home, too."</p>

<p>"Why, so you shall!" cried Santa; "for I'm sure your father and mother
will be glad to see you again. Mr. Wizard, please blow a big, fine
bubble for Button-Bright to ride in, and I'll agree to send him home to
his family as safe as safe can be."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Dorothy with a sigh, for she was fond of her little
comrade; "but p'raps it's best for Button-Bright to get home; 'cause
his folks must be worrying just dreadful."</p>

<p>She kissed the boy, and Ozma kissed him, too, and all the others waved
their hands and said good-bye and wished him a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>"Are you glad to leave us, dear?" asked Dorothy, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Button-Bright.</p>

<p>He sat down cross-legged on the platform, with his sailor hat tipped
back on his head, and the Wizard blew a beautiful bubble all around him.</p>

<p>A minute later it had mounted into the sky, sailing toward the west, and
the last they saw of Button-Bright he was still sitting in the middle of
the shining globe and waving his sailor-hat at those below.</p>

<p>"Will you ride in a bubble, or shall I send you and Toto home by means
of the Magic Belt?" the Princess asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll use the Belt," replied the little girl. "I'm sort of 'fraid
of those bubbles."</p>

<p>"Bow-wow!" said Toto, approvingly. He loved to bark at the bubbles as
they sailed away, but he didn't care to ride in one.</p>

<p>Santa Claus decided to go next. He thanked Ozma for her hospitality and
wished her many happy returns of the day. Then the Wizard blew a bubble
around his chubby little body and smaller bubbles around each of his
Ryls and Knooks.</p>

<p>As the kind and generous friend of children mounted into the air the
people all cheered at the top of their voices, for they loved Santa
Claus dearly; and the little man heard them through the walls of the
bubble and waved his hands in return as he smiled down upon them. The
band played bravely while every one watched the bubble until it was
completely out of sight.</p>

<p>"How 'bout you, Polly?" Dorothy asked her friend. "Are you 'fraid of
bubbles, too?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Polychrome, smiling; "but Santa Claus promised to speak
to my father as he passed through the sky. So perhaps I shall get home
an easier way."</p>

<p>Indeed, the little maid had scarcely made this speech when a sudden
radiance filled the air, and while the people looked on in wonder the
end of a gorgeous rainbow slowly settled down upon the platform.</p>

<p>With a glad cry the Rainbow's Daughter sprang from her seat and danced
along the curve of the bow, mounting gradually upward, while the folds
of her gauzy gown whirled and floated around her like a cloud and
blended with the colors of the rainbow itself.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="images/i259.png"
style="border:10px double black;"
width="550px"
height="772px"
alt="&quot;GOOD-BYE, OZMA! GOOD-BYE, DOROTHY!&quot;" /><br />"GOOD-BYE, OZMA! GOOD-BYE, DOROTHY!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Ozma! Good-bye, Dorothy!" cried a voice they knew belonged
to Polychrome; but now the little maiden's form had melted wholly into
the rainbow, and their eyes could no longer see her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the end of the rainbow lifted and its colors slowly faded like
mist before a breeze. Dorothy sighed deeply and turned to Ozma.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to lose Polly," she said; "but I guess she's better off with
her father; 'cause even the Land of Oz couldn't be like home to a cloud
fairy."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied the Princess; "but it has been delightful for us
to know Polychrome for a little while, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps we may
meet the Rainbow's daughter again, some day."</p>

<p>The entertainment being now ended, all left the pavilion and formed
their gay procession back to the Emerald City again. Of Dorothy's recent
traveling companions only Toto and the shaggy man remained, and Ozma had
decided to allow the latter to live in Oz for a time, at least. If he
proved honest and true she promised to let him live there always, and
the shaggy man was anxious to earn this reward.</p>

<p>They had a nice quiet dinner together and passed a pleasant evening with
the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Tik-tok, and the Yellow Hen for company.</p>

<p>When Dorothy bade them good-night she kissed them all good-bye at the
same time. For Ozma had agreed that while Dorothy slept she and Toto
should be transported by means of the Magic Belt to her own little bed
in the Kansas farmhouse and the little girl laughed as she thought how
astonished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em would be when she came down to
breakfast with them next morning.</p>

<p>Quite content to have had so pleasant an adventure, and a little tired
by all the day's busy scenes, Dorothy clasped Toto in her arms and lay
down upon the pretty white bed in her room in Ozma's royal palace.</p>

<p>Presently she was sound asleep.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
